It seems like each layer is multiplying 3 by something, and that something is 1 plus another set of 3 multiplied by something else. It's kind of a recursive structure, isn't it?

Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\\n\\nHmm, same result as before. It seems consistent. But let me verify one more time to be sure.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\\n\\nYes, same result each time. So, I think 88,572 is the correct answer.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more quickly, but since it's only nine layers deep, manually computing each step isn't too bad. But if I wanted to generalize this for a larger number of layers, perhaps I could find a formula.\\n\\nLooking at the pattern, each time we have 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, if I let a\\u2081 = 1 + 3*a\\u2080, but wait, actually starting from the innermost, the first layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous.\\n\\nSo, each layer is defined recursively as a\\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\\u2099\\u208b\\u2081, starting with a\\u2080 = 1.\\n\\nWait, actually, in this case, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, so a\\u2081 = 4, then a\\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\\u2081 = 13, a\\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\\u2082 = 40, and so on, up to a\\u2089, which is 29524. Then, the outermost operation is 3*a\\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\\n\\nSo, in general, each step is a multiplication by 3 and then adding 1. This is similar to a geometric progression but with a multiplicative factor of 3 each time and an additive factor of 1.\\n\\nAlternatively, we can model this as a linear recurrence relation. The recurrence is a\\u2099 = 3*a\\u2099\\u208b\\u2081 + 1, with a\\u2080 = 1. Solving this recurrence relation might give us a closed-form expression, but since we only have nine layers, maybe it's not necessary here.\\n\\nBut for the sake of thoroughness, let's try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence relation is linear and nonhomogeneous. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\\n\\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a\\u2099 - 3*a\\u2099\\u208b\\u2081 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a\\u2099^h = C*3\\u207f, where C is a constant.\\n\\nNext, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a\\u2099^p = K.\\n\\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\\n\\nThus, the general solution is a\\u2099 = a\\u2099^h + a\\u2099^p = C*3\\u207f - 1/2.\\n\\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n = 0, a\\u2080 = 1. So:\\n\\n1 = C*3\\u2070 - 1/2 => 1 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\\n\\nThus, the closed-form solution is a\\u2099 = (3/2)*3\\u207f - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\\n\\nSo, for our problem, we have n = 9 layers (from a\\u2080 to a\\u2089). Wait, actually, let's see: when n=0, a\\u2080=1 (innermost), then a\\u2081=4, a\\u2082=13, up to a\\u2089=29524. So, to get a\\u2089, n=9.\\n\\nThus, a\\u2089 = (3^(9+1) - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 1)/2.\\n\\nCalculating 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\\n\\nSo, a\\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\\n\\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*a\\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\\n\\nTherefore, whether I compute step by step or use the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\\n\\nJust to make sure, let me compute the closed-form expression:\\n\\na\\u2089 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\\n\\nThen, 3*a\\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\\n\\nYep, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, I could have thought of this as each layer being a multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a base-3 expansion or something, but I think the step-by-step computation and the closed-form solution both confirm that the answer is 88,572.\\n\\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the result is correct.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe given expression is a series of nested multiplications and additions.

Okay, so the structure is 3 multiplied by a series of nested expressions. Each expression inside the parentheses seems to follow the pattern of 1 plus 3 times something. It looks like a recursive pattern, where each level has a 1 plus 3 times the next level.\\n\\nMaybe I can work from the inside out. That usually helps with nested expressions. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each set has 1 + 3. Let's see:\\n\\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3).\\n2. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3 times that result.\\n3. Repeating this process, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3.\\n\\nI wonder how many layers there are in total. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \\\"(\\\" corresponds to a new layer. Starting from the first 3(...), there are 8 opening parentheses after that.

Let me recount:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n- The first \\\"(\\\" is after 1 + 3, which is the innermost.\\n- Then each subsequent \\\"(\\\" adds another layer.\\n\\nWait, actually, the expression is 3(...), so the very first \\\"(\\\" is the first layer. Then inside that, there's another \\\"(\\\", so that's two layers, and so on. So counting each \\\"(\\\", starting from the first one, how many are there?

Maybe it's better to just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\\n\\nLet me try that approach.\\n\\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\\n\\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\\n\\nThen, moving one layer out:\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nWait, but the original expression starts with 3 multiplied by all these layers. So, does that mean I need to multiply the final layer by 3?\\n\\nWait, let me check the structure again:\\n\\nIt's 3 times (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))). So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of all the nested layers.\\n\\nSo, if I've computed up to Layer 9, which is 29524, but that's just the innermost part. Wait, no. Wait, actually, each layer is building up the nested expression. So, if I have 9 layers, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the final result would be Layer 9.\\n\\nBut wait, when I started, the first Layer 1 was (1 + 3) = 4, then Layer 2 was 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 was 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to Layer 9: 29524.\\n\\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\\n\\nWait, but hold on, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the first 3 is multiplying the entire expression. So, if I have computed up to Layer 9, which is 29524, that's the innermost value. But then, is the entire expression 3*29524? That seems too straightforward, but let me check.\\n\\nWait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have 9 layers, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, then Layer 9 is the outermost layer. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524.\\n\\nBut let me verify that.\\n\\nWait, let's think about a smaller version of this problem. Suppose I have 3(1 + 3). That would be 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\\n\\nIf I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)), that's 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\\n\\nSimilarly, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\\n\\nWait a minute, so each time we add a layer, we get 3 times the previous result. So, starting from 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39, then 3*(1 + 3*13) = 120, then 3*(1 + 3*40) = 3*121 = 363, and so on.\\n\\nSo, in this way, each additional layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 3*(previous result) + 1. Wait, but actually, each time we add a layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result), so it's 1 + 3*previous.\\n\\nBut when we multiply the entire expression by 3, as in the original problem, which is 3*(...), so the 3 is multiplying the result of the entire nested expression.\\n\\nWait, in the smaller examples, like 3*(1 + 3) = 12, that's 3*(1 + 3). Similarly, 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39. So, each time, the 3 is multiplying the entire nested expression.\\n\\nTherefore, in the original problem, which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))). So, the entire nested expression is built up with 9 layers, and then multiplied by 3.\\n\\nSo, if I have computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\\n\\n3*29524: 29524*3.\\n\\nCompute 29524*3:\\n\\n24*3 = 72\\n\\n4*3 = 12, plus 72 is 84\\n\\n9*3 = 27, plus 84 is 111\\n\\n5*3 = 15, plus 111 is 126\\n\\n2*3 = 6, plus 126 is 132\\n\\nWait, no, that seems incorrect. Wait, 29524*3:\\n\\nCompute each digit:\\n\\nStarting from the right:\\n\\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\\n\\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\\n\\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\\n\\n9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\\n\\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\\n\\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\\n\\nWait, let me verify:\\n\\n29524 * 3:\\n\\n20000*3 = 60000\\n\\n9000*3 = 27000\\n\\n500*3 = 1500\\n\\n20*3 = 60\\n\\n4*3 = 12\\n\\nAdding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\\n\\nBut wait, hold on, earlier when I was computing layers, I went up to Layer 9: 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that Layer 9 is indeed the correct value.\\n\\nLet me recount the layers:\\n\\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\\n\\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer step by step again:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or look for a pattern, but since the expression is only 8 or 9 layers deep, computing each step is manageable.\\n\\nJust to ensure I didn't miscount the layers, let me write down each step clearly:\\n\\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\\n\\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. I think I'm confident with this answer.\\n\\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, we can compute a_2 through a_9 as above, and then multiply by 3.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I recognize that a_n follows a geometric progression, but in this case, since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous, it's a linear recurrence relation. However, since the number of layers is small, computing each term step by step is straightforward.\\n\\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying each step, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88,572.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of the expression is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given expression, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The expression is:\\n\\n\\\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\]\\n\\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost parentheses:\\n\\n1. Layer 1: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n2. Layer 2: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n3. Layer 3: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n4.

Layer 9: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\\\)\\n\\nAfter computing all layers, we multiply the result by 3:\\n\\n\\\\[ 3 \\\\times 29524 = 88572 \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the value of the expression is \\\\(\\\\boxed{88572}\\\\).\",\n",

Problem: Compute\\n\\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ Solution: \\n<think>\\nAlright, so I've got this math problem to solve: Compute this long expression with a bunch of nested parentheses. It looks pretty complicated at first glance, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it won't be so bad. Let me write it out again to visualize it better:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nWow, that's a lot of nesting! Okay, so the structure is 3 multiplied by a series of nested expressions. Each expression inside the parentheses seems to follow the pattern of 1 plus 3 times something. It looks like a recursive pattern, where each level has a 1 plus 3 times the next level.\\n\\nMaybe I can work from the inside out. That usually helps with nested expressions. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each set has 1 + 3. Let's see:\\n\\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3).\\n2. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3 times that result.\\n3. Repeating this process, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3.\\n\\nI wonder how many layers there are in total. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \\\"(\\\" corresponds to a new layer. Starting from the first 3(...), there are 8 opening parentheses after that. So, that means there are 8 layers of nesting. Hmm, or wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me recount:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n- The first \\\"(\\\" is after 1 + 3, which is the innermost.\\n- Then each subsequent \\\"(\\\" adds another layer.\\n\\nWait, actually, the expression is 3(...), so the very first \\\"(\\\" is the first layer. Then inside that, there's another \\\"(\\\", so that's two layers, and so on. So counting each \\\"(\\\", starting from the first one, how many are there? Let's see:\\n\\n1. 3(\\n2. 1 + 3(\\n3. 1 + 3(\\n4. 1 + 3(\\n5. 1 + 3(\\n6. 1 + 3(\\n7. 1 + 3(\\n8. 1 + 3(\\n9. 1 + 3(\\n10. 1 + 3(\\n11. 1 + 3)\\n12. )\\n13. )\\n14. )\\n15. )\\n16. )\\n17. )\\n18. )\\n19. )\\n20. )\\n\\nWait, that seems like 20 layers, but actually, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer, but the way it's written, each \\\"3(\\\" starts a new layer. So perhaps it's 8 layers?

Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern in the expression. Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous expression. So, if I define a sequence where a\\u2081 = 1 + 3, a\\u2082 = 1 + 3a\\u2081, a\\u2083 = 1 + 3a\\u2082, and so on, up to a\\u2088, since there are 8 layers of nesting.\\n\\nWait, let me check how many times the pattern \\\"1 + 3(\\\" repeats.

So, starting from 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39, then 3*(1 + 3*13) = 120, then 3*(1 + 3*40) = 3*121 = 363, and so on.\\n\\nSo, in this way, each additional layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 3*(previous result) + 1.

Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. I think I'm confident with this answer.\\n\\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, we can compute a_2 through a_9 as above, and then multiply by 3.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I recognize that a_n follows a geometric progression, but in this case, since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous, it's a linear recurrence relation. However, since the number of layers is small, computing each term step by step is straightforward.\\n\\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying each step, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88,572.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of the expression is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given expression, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The expression is:\\n\\n\\\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\]\\n\\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost parentheses:\\n\\n1. Layer 1: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n2. Layer 2: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n3. Layer 3: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n4.

Layer 7: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\)\\n8. Layer 8: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\)\\n9. Layer 9: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\\\)\\n\\nAfter computing all layers, we multiply the result by 3:\\n\\n\\\\[ 3 \\\\times 29524 = 88572 \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the value of the expression is \\\\(\\\\boxed{88572}\\\\).\",\n",

Yes, because it's 3 times the previous expression plus 1.\\n\\nSo, starting from 4, each time it's 3*previous +1.\\n\\nSo, 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, and finally multiplied by 3 gives 29523.\\n\\nSo, the final result is 29523.\\n\\nBut let me double-check by computing each layer again.\\n\\n1.

So, I think I can be confident that the result is 29523.\\n\\nWait a second, but let me think again. The original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, in the last step, I computed Layer 9 as 3*9841, which is 29523. But let me confirm if that's correct.\\n\\nLooking back at the original problem:\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nYes, so it's 3 multiplied by the entire expression inside the parentheses, which after 8 layers of computation becomes 9841, so 3*9841 is indeed 29523.\\n\\nTherefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 29523.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{29523}\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the expression \\\\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\\\), we start by working from the innermost parentheses outward.\\n\\n1.

Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\\n\\nStarting again:\\n\\n1. **Layer 1:** \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\n2. **Layer 2:** \\\\(1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n\\n3. **Layer 3:** \\\\(1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n\\n4. **Layer 4:** \\\\(1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n\\n5. **Layer 5:** \\\\(1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\)\\n\\n6. **Layer 6:** \\\\(1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\)\\n\\n7. **Layer 7:** \\\\(1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\)\\n\\n8. **Layer 8:** \\\\(1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\)\\n\\n9. **Layer 9:** \\\\(3*9841 = 29523\\\\)\\n\\nHmm, that seems consistent each time. Each layer is \\\\(1 + 3*(previous layer)\\\\). So, each time, I'm tripling the previous result and adding 1.\\n\\nWait, but let me check: is each layer multiplied by 3 and then added 1? Yes, because it's 3 times the previous expression plus 1.\\n\\nSo, starting from 4, each time it's 3*previous +1.\\n\\nSo, 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, and finally multiplied by 3 gives 29523.\\n\\nSo, the final result is 29523.\\n\\nBut let me double-check by computing each layer again.\\n\\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n\\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n\\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n\\n9. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So, the value of the expression is 29523.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small table to keep track:\\n\\n| Layer | Calculation | Result |\\n|------|-------------|--------|\\n| 1    | 1 + 3       | 4      |\\n| 2    | 1 + 3*4     | 13     |\\n| 3    | 1 + 3*13    | 40     |\\n| 4    | 1 + 3*40    | 121    |\\n| 5    | 1 + 3*121   | 364    |\\n| 6    | 1 + 3*364   | 1093   |\\n| 7    | 1 + 3*1093  | 3280   |\\n| 8    | 1 + 3*3280  | 9841   |\\n| 9    | 3*9841      | 29523  |\\n\\nYes, that table confirms my earlier computations. So, I think I can be confident that the result is 29523.\\n\\nWait a second, but let me think again. The original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, in the last step, I computed Layer 9 as 3*9841, which is 29523. But let me confirm if that's correct.\\n\\nLooking back at the original problem:\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nYes, so it's 3 multiplied by the entire expression inside the parentheses, which after 8 layers of computation becomes 9841, so 3*9841 is indeed 29523.\\n\\nTherefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 29523.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{29523}\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the expression \\\\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\\\), we start by working from the innermost parentheses outward.\\n\\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\\n   \\\\[\\n   1 + 3 = 4\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. Substitute back into the expression and compute the next layer:\\n   \\\\[\\n   1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\\n   \\\\[\\n   1 + 3 \\\\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   1 + 3 \\\\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   1 + 3 \\\\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   1 + 3 \\\\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   1 + 3 \\\\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\\\[\\n   1 + 3 \\\\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. Finally, multiply the result by 3:\\n   \\\\[\\n   3 \\\\times 9841 = 29523\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the value of the given expression is \\\\(\\\\boxed{29523}\\\\).\",\n",

Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance with all those nested parentheses. But I think if I break it down step by step, it should be manageable.\\n\\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built using a pattern of multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like each layer is similar, just nested deeper. Maybe there's a recursive way to approach this, but since it's finite, working from the innermost parentheses might be the way to go.\\n\\nLet me rewrite the expression to see the structure better:\\n\\n\\\\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\)\\n\\nCounting the number of parentheses, it seems there are nine levels deep. That is, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), and working my way out. So perhaps if I compute each level starting from the innermost, I can build up the result.\\n\\nLet me label each level to keep track:\\n\\n1. Level 1: \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n2. Level 2: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 1})\\\\)\\n3. Level 3: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 2})\\\\)\\n4. Level 4: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 3})\\\\)\\n5. Level 5: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 4})\\\\)\\n6. Level 6: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 5})\\\\)\\n7. Level 7: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 6})\\\\)\\n8. Level 8: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 7})\\\\)\\n9. Level 9: \\\\(3(\\\\text{Level 8})\\\\)\\n\\nWait, actually, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, not adding 1. So maybe the last level is just multiplying the result of Level 8 by 3.\\n\\nLet me adjust the labels:\\n\\n1. Level 1: \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n2. Level 2: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 1})\\\\)\\n3. Level 3: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 2})\\\\)\\n4. Level 4: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 3})\\\\)\\n5. Level 5: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 4})\\\\)\\n6. Level 6: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 5})\\\\)\\n7. Level 7: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 6})\\\\)\\n8. Level 8: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 7})\\\\)\\n9. Level 9: \\\\(3(\\\\text{Level 8})\\\\)\\n\\nYes, that makes sense. So I need to compute from Level 1 up to Level 9, each time plugging the result of the previous level into the next one.\\n\\nStarting with Level 1: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 2: \\\\(1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 3: \\\\(1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 4: \\\\(1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 5: \\\\(1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 6: \\\\(1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 7: \\\\(1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 8: \\\\(1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 9: \\\\(3(9841) = 29523\\\\).\\n\\nWait, so the final result is 29,523. Hmm, let me verify each step to ensure I haven't made a calculation error.\\n\\nStarting with Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\\n\\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay.\\n\\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\\n\\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Yes.\\n\\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That's right.\\n\\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\\n\\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\\n\\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\\n\\nLevel 9: 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27,000, 3*800=2,400, 3*41=123. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 123 = 29,523. Yes, that's correct.\\n\\nSo, after computing each level step by step, I arrive at 29,523 as the result.\\n\\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something similar, but given that it's a finite nested expression, the step-by-step computation seems appropriate.\\n\\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is \\\\( a_{n} = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\\\). The solution to this recurrence would be \\\\( a_n = 3^{n} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think.\\n\\nActually, for the recurrence \\\\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\\\), the homogeneous solution is \\\\( A \\\\cdot 3^{n} \\\\), and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution \\\\( a_n = C \\\\). Plugging into the recurrence:\\n\\n\\\\( C = 3C + 1 \\\\Rightarrow -2C = 1 \\\\Rightarrow C = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is \\\\( a_n = A \\\\cdot 3^{n} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nApplying the initial condition, when n=1, \\\\( a_1 = 4 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( 4 = A \\\\cdot 3^{1} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Rightarrow 4 = 3A - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Rightarrow 3A = 4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{2} \\\\Rightarrow A = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nThus, the general formula is \\\\( a_n = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\cdot 3^{n} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nBut wait, in our case, n is the level starting from 1. So for Level 1, n=1, which gives \\\\( a_1 = \\\\frac{3^{2}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = 4 \\\\). That's correct.\\n\\nFor Level 2, n=2: \\\\( a_2 = \\\\frac{3^{3}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{27}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = 13 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, Level 3: \\\\( a_3 = \\\\frac{3^4}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{81}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = 40 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nSo, in general, Level k: \\\\( a_k = \\\\frac{3^{k+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, for Level 9: \\\\( a_9 = \\\\frac{3^{10}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{59049}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{59048}{2} = 29524 \\\\).\\n\\nWait a second, that's 29,524, but earlier I computed it as 29,523. There's a discrepancy here.\\n\\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the general formula. Let me check.\\n\\nWait, the recurrence is \\\\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\\\). The solution is \\\\( a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n} - 1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nWait, let's derive that again.\\n\\nThe homogeneous solution is \\\\( A \\\\cdot 3^{n} \\\\). The particular solution is a constant, \\\\( C \\\\). So:\\n\\n\\\\( C = 3C + 1 \\\\Rightarrow -2C = 1 \\\\Rightarrow C = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nThus, the general solution is \\\\( a_n = A \\\\cdot 3^{n} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nApplying initial condition \\\\( a_1 = 4 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( 4 = 3A - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Rightarrow 3A = 4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{2} \\\\Rightarrow A = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nThus, \\\\( a_n = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\cdot 3^{n} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nSo, for Level 9, n=9: \\\\( a_9 = \\\\frac{3^{10}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{59049}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{59048}{2} = 29524 \\\\).\\n\\nBut when I computed step by step, I got 29,523. So which one is correct?\\n\\nWait, let's check Level 1 to Level 9:\\n\\nLevel 1: 4\\n\\nLevel 2: 13\\n\\nLevel 3: 40\\n\\nLevel 4: 121\\n\\nLevel 5: 364\\n\\nLevel 6: 1093\\n\\nLevel 7: 3280\\n\\nLevel 8: 9841\\n\\nLevel 9: 29523\\n\\nWait, so according to the step-by-step computation, Level 9 is 29,523, but according to the formula, it's 29,524.\\n\\nThere must be a miscalculation somewhere.\\n\\nWait, let me recompute the step-by-step.\\n\\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLevel 9: 3*9841 = 29523\\n\\nSo, step-by-step, Level 9 is 29,523. But the formula gives 29,524. There's a difference of 1.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the formula is off by one. Let me see.\\n\\nWait, in the formula, Level k corresponds to n=k, but in our step-by-step, Level 1 is n=1, and Level 9 is n=9, which should be \\\\( a_9 = \\\\frac{3^{10}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = 29524 \\\\).\\n\\nBut our step-by-step gives 29523. So there's a discrepancy.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the formula is for n=0? Let me check.\\n\\nIf n=0, then \\\\( a_0 = \\\\frac{3^{1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3 - 1}{2} = 1 \\\\). Then, Level 1 would be \\\\( a_1 = 3a_0 + 1 = 3*1 +1=4 \\\\), which matches.\\n\\nSo, Level k corresponds to n=k-1 in the formula.\\n\\nThus, Level 9 would correspond to n=8: \\\\( a_8 = \\\\frac{3^{9}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{19683}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{19682}{2} = 9841 \\\\). Which matches Level 8.\\n\\nThen Level 9 is 3*a_8 = 3*9841=29523.\\n\\nSo, the formula gives Level 9 as 3*a_8, which is 29,523. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in interpreting the formula.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should index the formula differently.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula gives the value at Level k as \\\\( \\\\frac{3^{k+1} -1}{2} \\\\). Let me check.\\n\\nWait, for Level 1: \\\\( (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 2: \\\\( (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=13 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 3: \\\\( (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 4: \\\\( (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 5: \\\\( (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 6: \\\\( (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 7: \\\\( (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 8: \\\\( (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 9: \\\\( (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \\\\). Wait, but according to step-by-step, Level 9 is 3*9841=29523. Hmm.\\n\\nWait, no. The formula gives Level k as \\\\( (3^{k+1} -1)/2 \\\\). So Level 9 would be \\\\( (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=29524 \\\\).\\n\\nBut in our step-by-step, Level 9 is 3*Level8=3*9841=29523.\\n\\nSo, the formula suggests that Level9=29524, but step-by-step it's 29523. There's a discrepancy.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula.

Hmm, maybe not.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is for the number of times you apply the operation.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the formula is for n operations, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\\n\\nBut in our case, starting from 1+3, which is n=1, then each subsequent layer is n=2,...,n=9.\\n\\nBut according to the formula, n=9 would correspond to 29524, but step-by-step gives 29523.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I should check the formula again.\\n\\nWait, let's compute a few more terms.\\n\\nFrom the recurrence:\\n\\na1=4\\n\\na2=13\\n\\na3=40\\n\\na4=121\\n\\na5=364\\n\\na6=1093\\n\\na7=3280\\n\\na8=9841\\n\\na9=29523\\n\\nSo, according to the recurrence, a9=29523.\\n\\nBut the formula gives (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\\n\\nWait, so there's a discrepancy.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the formula is for n=0, which gives a0=1, then a1=3*1 +1=4, which matches.\\n\\nSo, in general, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\\n\\nSo, for n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\\n\\nBut according to the recurrence, a9=29523.\\n\\nWait, that suggests a mistake in the recurrence.\\n\\nWait, no, according to the recurrence, a9=3*a8 +1.\\n\\nBut wait, in the original problem, the outermost operation is 3*(...), not a_n=3*a_{n-1}+1.\\n\\nWait, let me clarify.\\n\\nIn the original problem, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the recurrence is a_n=3*a_{n-1}+1.\\n\\nBut in our case, the innermost layer is a1=1+3=4.\\n\\nThen a2=1+3*a1=13\\n\\na3=1+3*a2=40\\n\\n...\\n\\na8=1+3*a7=9841\\n\\nThen the final operation is 3*a8=29523.\\n\\nSo, the final result is 3*a8, not a9.\\n\\nThus, the formula gives a8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=9841, which matches.\\n\\nThen, the final result is 3*a8=3*9841=29523.\\n\\nSo, in this case, the formula gives a8=9841, which is correct, and then the final step is multiplying by 3, giving 29523.\\n\\nTherefore, the step-by-step computation is correct, and the formula gives the same result when considering that the final step is an extra multiplication by 3, not part of the recurrence.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, the final answer is 29,523.\\n\\nJust to double-check, let me compute the entire expression step by step without labeling:\\n\\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\\n\\n1+3=4\\n\\nThen, moving outward:\\n\\n1+3*4=1+12=13\\n\\nNext:\\n\\n1+3*13=1+39=40\\n\\nNext:\\n\\n1+3*40=1+120=121\\n\\nNext:\\n\\n1+3*121=1+363=364\\n\\nNext:\\n\\n1+3*364=1+1092=1093\\n\\nNext:\\n\\n1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\\n\\nNext:\\n\\n1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\\n\\nFinally, multiply by 3:\\n\\n3*9841=29523\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the result of the expression is 29,523.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe given expression is a nested computation involving repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1.

Problem: Compute\\n\\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ Solution: \\n<think>\\nAlright, so I have this math problem to solve: Compute \\\\( 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\\\). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance with all those nested parentheses. But I think if I break it down step by step, it should be manageable.\\n\\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built using a pattern of multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like each layer is similar, just nested deeper. Maybe there's a recursive way to approach this, but since it's finite, working from the innermost parentheses might be the way to go.\\n\\nLet me rewrite the expression to see the structure better:\\n\\n\\\\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\)\\n\\nCounting the number of parentheses, it seems there are nine levels deep. That is, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), and working my way out. So perhaps if I compute each level starting from the innermost, I can build up the result.\\n\\nLet me label each level to keep track:\\n\\n1. Level 1: \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n2. Level 2: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 1})\\\\)\\n3. Level 3: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 2})\\\\)\\n4. Level 4: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 3})\\\\)\\n5. Level 5: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 4})\\\\)\\n6. Level 6: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 5})\\\\)\\n7. Level 7: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 6})\\\\)\\n8. Level 8: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 7})\\\\)\\n9. Level 9: \\\\(3(\\\\text{Level 8})\\\\)\\n\\nWait, actually, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, not adding 1. So maybe the last level is just multiplying the result of Level 8 by 3.\\n\\nLet me adjust the labels:\\n\\n1. Level 1: \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n2. Level 2: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 1})\\\\)\\n3. Level 3: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 2})\\\\)\\n4. Level 4: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 3})\\\\)\\n5. Level 5: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 4})\\\\)\\n6. Level 6: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Level 5})\\\\)\\n7.

So I need to compute from Level 1 up to Level 9, each time plugging the result of the previous level into the next one.\\n\\nStarting with Level 1: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 2: \\\\(1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 3: \\\\(1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 4: \\\\(1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 5: \\\\(1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 6: \\\\(1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 7: \\\\(1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 8: \\\\(1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\).\\n\\nLevel 9: \\\\(3(9841) = 29523\\\\).\\n\\nWait, so the final result is 29,523. Hmm, let me verify each step to ensure I haven't made a calculation error.\\n\\nStarting with Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\\n\\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay.\\n\\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\\n\\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Yes.\\n\\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That's right.\\n\\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\\n\\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\\n\\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\\n\\nLevel 9: 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27,000, 3*800=2,400, 3*41=123. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 123 = 29,523. Yes, that's correct.\\n\\nSo, after computing each level step by step, I arrive at 29,523 as the result.\\n\\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something similar, but given that it's a finite nested expression, the step-by-step computation seems appropriate.\\n\\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is \\\\( a_{n} = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\\\). The solution to this recurrence would be \\\\( a_n = 3^{n} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think.\\n\\nActually, for the recurrence \\\\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\\\), the homogeneous solution is \\\\( A \\\\cdot 3^{n} \\\\), and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution \\\\( a_n = C \\\\). Plugging into the recurrence:\\n\\n\\\\( C = 3C + 1 \\\\Rightarrow -2C = 1 \\\\Rightarrow C = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is \\\\( a_n = A \\\\cdot 3^{n} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nApplying the initial condition, when n=1, \\\\( a_1 = 4 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( 4 = A \\\\cdot 3^{1} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Rightarrow 4 = 3A - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Rightarrow 3A = 4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{2} \\\\Rightarrow A = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nThus, the general formula is \\\\( a_n = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\cdot 3^{n} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nBut wait, in our case, n is the level starting from 1. So for Level 1, n=1, which gives \\\\( a_1 = \\\\frac{3^{2}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = 4 \\\\). That's correct.\\n\\nFor Level 2, n=2: \\\\( a_2 = \\\\frac{3^{3}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{27}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = 13 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, Level 3: \\\\( a_3 = \\\\frac{3^4}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{81}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = 40 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nSo, in general, Level k: \\\\( a_k = \\\\frac{3^{k+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, for Level 9: \\\\( a_9 = \\\\frac{3^{10}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{59049}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{59048}{2} = 29524 \\\\).\\n\\nWait a second, that's 29,524, but earlier I computed it as 29,523. There's a discrepancy here.\\n\\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the general formula. Let me check.\\n\\nWait, the recurrence is \\\\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\\\). The solution is \\\\( a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n} - 1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nWait, let's derive that again.\\n\\nThe homogeneous solution is \\\\( A \\\\cdot 3^{n} \\\\). The particular solution is a constant, \\\\( C \\\\). So:\\n\\n\\\\( C = 3C + 1 \\\\Rightarrow -2C = 1 \\\\Rightarrow C = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nThus, the general solution is \\\\( a_n = A \\\\cdot 3^{n} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nApplying initial condition \\\\( a_1 = 4 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( 4 = 3A - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Rightarrow 3A = 4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{2} \\\\Rightarrow A = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nThus, \\\\( a_n = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\cdot 3^{n} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\).\\n\\nSo, for Level 9, n=9: \\\\( a_9 = \\\\frac{3^{10}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{59049}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{59048}{2} = 29524 \\\\).\\n\\nBut when I computed step by step, I got 29,523. So which one is correct?\\n\\nWait, let's check Level 1 to Level 9:\\n\\nLevel 1: 4\\n\\nLevel 2: 13\\n\\nLevel 3: 40\\n\\nLevel 4: 121\\n\\nLevel 5: 364\\n\\nLevel 6: 1093\\n\\nLevel 7: 3280\\n\\nLevel 8: 9841\\n\\nLevel 9: 29523\\n\\nWait, so according to the step-by-step computation, Level 9 is 29,523, but according to the formula, it's 29,524.\\n\\nThere must be a miscalculation somewhere.\\n\\nWait, let me recompute the step-by-step.\\n\\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLevel 9: 3*9841 = 29523\\n\\nSo, step-by-step, Level 9 is 29,523. But the formula gives 29,524. There's a difference of 1.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the formula is off by one. Let me see.\\n\\nWait, in the formula, Level k corresponds to n=k, but in our step-by-step, Level 1 is n=1, and Level 9 is n=9, which should be \\\\( a_9 = \\\\frac{3^{10}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = 29524 \\\\).\\n\\nBut our step-by-step gives 29523. So there's a discrepancy.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the formula is for n=0? Let me check.\\n\\nIf n=0, then \\\\( a_0 = \\\\frac{3^{1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3 - 1}{2} = 1 \\\\). Then, Level 1 would be \\\\( a_1 = 3a_0 + 1 = 3*1 +1=4 \\\\), which matches.\\n\\nSo, Level k corresponds to n=k-1 in the formula.\\n\\nThus, Level 9 would correspond to n=8: \\\\( a_8 = \\\\frac{3^{9}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{19683}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{19682}{2} = 9841 \\\\). Which matches Level 8.\\n\\nThen Level 9 is 3*a_8 = 3*9841=29523.\\n\\nSo, the formula gives Level 9 as 3*a_8, which is 29,523. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in interpreting the formula.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should index the formula differently.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula gives the value at Level k as \\\\( \\\\frac{3^{k+1} -1}{2} \\\\). Let me check.\\n\\nWait, for Level 1: \\\\( (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 2: \\\\( (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=13 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 3: \\\\( (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 4: \\\\( (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 5: \\\\( (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 6: \\\\( (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 7: \\\\( (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 8: \\\\( (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLevel 9: \\\\( (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \\\\). Wait, but according to step-by-step, Level 9 is 3*9841=29523. Hmm.\\n\\nWait, no. The formula gives Level k as \\\\( (3^{k+1} -1)/2 \\\\). So Level 9 would be \\\\( (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=29524 \\\\).\\n\\nBut in our step-by-step, Level 9 is 3*Level8=3*9841=29523.\\n\\nSo, the formula suggests that Level9=29524, but step-by-step it's 29523. There's a discrepancy.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula. Let me check the recurrence again.\\n\\nThe recurrence is \\\\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} +1 \\\\), with \\\\( a_1 =4 \\\\).\\n\\nSo, \\\\( a_1=4 \\\\)\\n\\n\\\\( a_2=3*4 +1=13 \\\\)\\n\\n\\\\( a_3=3*13 +1=40 \\\\)\\n\\n\\\\( a_4=3*40 +1=121 \\\\)\\n\\n\\\\( a_5=3*121 +1=364 \\\\)\\n\\n\\\\( a_6=3*364 +1=1093 \\\\)\\n\\n\\\\( a_7=3*1093 +1=3280 \\\\)\\n\\n\\\\( a_8=3*3280 +1=9841 \\\\)\\n\\n\\\\( a_9=3*9841=29523 \\\\)\\n\\nWait, so Level 9 is \\\\( a_9 = 3a_8 \\\\), which is 29523.\\n\\nBut the formula \\\\( a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 \\\\) gives for n=9: (3^10 -1)/2=29524.\\n\\nSo, seems like the formula gives 29524, but step-by-step gives 29523.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct and I miscounted the number of levels.\\n\\nWait, the expression is:\\n\\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nLet's count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1+3\\n\\nThen each 1+3(...) adds another layer.\\n\\nSo, counting the number of 1+3 layers:\\n\\n1. 1+3\\n\\n2. 1+3(...)\\n\\n3. 1+3(...)\\n\\n4. 1+3(...)\\n\\n5. 1+3(...)\\n\\n6. 1+3(...)\\n\\n7. 1+3(...)\\n\\n8. 1+3(...)\\n\\n9. 1+3(...)\\n\\nThen multiplied by 3.\\n\\nWait, but in my earlier breakdown, I had 9 levels, but according to the formula, Level 9 corresponds to n=9, but in reality, the number of multiplications by 3 is 9 times, but the number of additions is 8? Hmm, maybe not.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is for the number of times you apply the operation.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the formula is for n operations, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\\n\\nBut in our case, starting from 1+3, which is n=1, then each subsequent layer is n=2,...,n=9.\\n\\nBut according to the formula, n=9 would correspond to 29524, but step-by-step gives 29523.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I should check the formula again.\\n\\nWait, let's compute a few more terms.\\n\\nFrom the recurrence:\\n\\na1=4\\n\\na2=13\\n\\na3=40\\n\\na4=121\\n\\na5=364\\n\\na6=1093\\n\\na7=3280\\n\\na8=9841\\n\\na9=29523\\n\\nSo, according to the recurrence, a9=29523.\\n\\nBut the formula gives (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\\n\\nWait, so there's a discrepancy.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the formula is for n=0, which gives a0=1, then a1=3*1 +1=4, which matches.\\n\\nSo, in general, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\\n\\nSo, for n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\\n\\nBut according to the recurrence, a9=29523.\\n\\nWait, that suggests a mistake in the recurrence.\\n\\nWait, no, according to the recurrence, a9=3*a8 +1.\\n\\nBut wait, in the original problem, the outermost operation is 3*(...), not a_n=3*a_{n-1}+1.\\n\\nWait, let me clarify.\\n\\nIn the original problem, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the recurrence is a_n=3*a_{n-1}+1.\\n\\nBut in our case, the innermost layer is a1=1+3=4.\\n\\nThen a2=1+3*a1=13\\n\\na3=1+3*a2=40\\n\\n...\\n\\na8=1+3*a7=9841\\n\\nThen the final operation is 3*a8=29523.\\n\\nSo, the final result is 3*a8, not a9.\\n\\nThus, the formula gives a8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=9841, which matches.\\n\\nThen, the final result is 3*a8=3*9841=29523.\\n\\nSo, in this case, the formula gives a8=9841, which is correct, and then the final step is multiplying by 3, giving 29523.\\n\\nTherefore, the step-by-step computation is correct, and the formula gives the same result when considering that the final step is an extra multiplication by 3, not part of the recurrence.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, the final answer is 29,523.\\n\\nJust to double-check, let me compute the entire expression step by step without labeling:\\n\\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\\n\\n1+3=4\\n\\nThen, moving outward:\\n\\n1+3*4=1+12=13\\n\\nNext:\\n\\n1+3*13=1+39=40\\n\\nNext:\\n\\n1+3*40=1+120=121\\n\\nNext:\\n\\n1+3*121=1+363=364\\n\\nNext:\\n\\n1+3*364=1+1092=1093\\n\\nNext:\\n\\n1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\\n\\nNext:\\n\\n1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\\n\\nFinally, multiply by 3:\\n\\n3*9841=29523\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the result of the expression is 29,523.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe given expression is a nested computation involving repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. By evaluating each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, we can systematically compute the result. \\n\\nHere's the breakdown:\\n\\n1. Innermost layer: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n2. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n3. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n4. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n5. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\)\\n6. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\)\\n7. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\)\\n8. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\)\\n9.

Each layer Ln = 1 + 3(Ln-1), starting from L1 = 1 + 3.\\n\\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\\n\\nSo, L1 = 4\\n\\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nWait, let me compute these step by step:\\n\\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nL10 = 1 + 3*L9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\n\\nSo, after computing all layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 88573.\\n\\nBut wait, the original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire inner expression.

So, L10 is 88573.\\n\\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * 88573.\\n\\nCalculating that:\\n\\n3 * 88573\\n\\nLet me compute 88573 * 3:\\n\\nFirst, 80,000 * 3 = 240,000\\n\\nThen, 8,000 * 3 = 24,000\\n\\n500 * 3 = 1,500\\n\\n70 * 3 = 210\\n\\n3 * 3 = 9\\n\\nAdding them together:\\n\\n240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\\n\\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\\n\\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\\n\\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719\\n\\nSo, 3 * 88,573 = 265,719.\\n\\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 265,719.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers.

It looks like each term is following a pattern where it's tripling the previous term and adding 1. This seems like a linear recurrence relation.\\n\\nI recall that for such linear recursions, there might be a closed-form formula to compute the nth term without having to calculate each step.

So, starting from \\\\(a_1 = 1\\\\):\\n\\n- \\\\(a_1 = 1\\\\)\\n- \\\\(a_2 = 1 + 3(1) = 4\\\\)\\n- \\\\(a_3 = 1 + 3(4) = 13\\\\)\\n- \\\\(a_4 = 1 + 3(13) = 40\\\\)\\n- \\\\(a_5 = 1 + 3(40) = 121\\\\)\\n- \\\\(a_6 = 1 + 3(121) = 364\\\\)\\n- \\\\(a_7 = 1 + 3(364) = 1093\\\\)\\n- \\\\(a_8 = 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\\\\)\\n- \\\\(a_9 = 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\\\\)\\n- \\\\(a_{10} = 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\\\\)\\n- Finally, the outermost operation is \\\\(3 \\\\times a_{10} = 3 \\\\times 29524 = 88572\\\\)\\n\\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. It looks like each term is following a pattern where it's tripling the previous term and adding 1. This seems like a linear recurrence relation.\\n\\nI recall that for such linear recursions, there might be a closed-form formula to compute the nth term without having to calculate each step. Maybe I can try to find that.\\n\\nThe general form of a linear recurrence is \\\\(a_n = c \\\\times a_{n-1} + d\\\\), where c and d are constants. In this case, \\\\(c = 3\\\\) and \\\\(d = 1\\\\). The solution for such a recurrence is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = c^{n-1} \\\\times a_1 + d \\\\times \\\\frac{c^{n-1} - 1}{c - 1}\\\\)\\n\\nPlugging in the values, \\\\(c = 3\\\\), \\\\(d = 1\\\\), \\\\(a_1 = 1\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = 3^{n-1} + \\\\frac{3^{n-1} - 1}{3 - 1} = 3^{n-1} + \\\\frac{3^{n-1} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSimplify that:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{2 \\\\times 3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nWait, let me verify that.\\n\\nStarting from the recurrence \\\\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\\\), with \\\\(a_1 = 1\\\\). The homogeneous solution is \\\\(A \\\\times 3^{n}\\\\), and the particular solution is a constant. Let me suppose the particular solution is \\\\(B\\\\). Then:\\n\\n\\\\(B = 3B + 1\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(B - 3B = 1\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(-2B = 1\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(B = -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo, the general solution is \\\\(a_n = A \\\\times 3^{n} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\). Applying the initial condition \\\\(a_1 = 1\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(1 = A \\\\times 3^{1} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(1 = 3A - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3A = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(A = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\div 3 = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\times 3^{n} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nYes, that matches what I had earlier. So, \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n} - 1}{2}\\\\). Therefore, for \\\\(n = 10\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(a_{10} = \\\\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3^{10}\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(3^1 = 3\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^2 = 9\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^3 = 27\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^4 = 81\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^5 = 243\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^6 = 729\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^7 = 2187\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^8 = 6561\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^9 = 19683\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^{10} = 59049\\\\)\\n\\nSo, \\\\(a_{10} = \\\\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{59048}{2} = 29524\\\\). Then, the outermost operation is \\\\(3 \\\\times 29524 = 88572\\\\), which matches my previous result.\\n\\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer, which is reassuring.\\n\\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that each step is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times \\\\text{previous}\\\\), which is similar to the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added, it's a bit different, but the closed-form formula still applies.\\n\\nIn any case, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, the result is 88,572.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{88572}\\n</think>\\n\\nTo compute the expression \\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out step by step.\\n\\n1.

I computed each layer step by step, verified the recurrence relation, solved it, and got the same result.

So, after computing L9, we have to multiply by 3.\\n\\nSo, the entire expression is 3 * L9.\\n\\nThus, the final result is 3 * 29524.\\n\\nLet me compute that:\\n\\n29524 * 3\\n\\nCompute 29524 * 3:\\n\\n24 * 3 = 72\\n\\n20 * 3 = 60, plus 72 is 132\\n\\n90 * 3 = 270, plus 132 is 402\\n\\n900 * 3 = 2700, plus 402 is 3102\\n\\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\\n\\nWait, let me verify that multiplication step by step:\\n\\n29524\\n*       3\\n--------\\nStarting from the right:\\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7\\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\\nSo, total is 88,572\\n\\nYes, 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing L1 to L9.\\n\\nStarting again:\\n\\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\nL7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\nL8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\nL9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nWait a second, but in the original problem, it's 3 multiplied by each layer. So, each L is already multiplied by 3.\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check the structure.\\n\\nOriginal expression:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3(...) is multiplied by 3 in the next layer.\\n\\nSo, actually, the structure is:\\n\\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, each 3 is multiplying the next layer, which is 1 + 3*(...).\\n\\nTherefore, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous).\\n\\nBut wait, the outermost is 3*(...). So, actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\\n\\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent is Layer 2, up to Layer 9. Then multiplied by 3, so total layers including the outermost 3 is 10? Or is it 9 layers?\\n\\nWait, no. The outermost is 3*(...), which is Layer 10? Or is it considered as the 9th layer?\\n\\nWait, actually, the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer is built upon that. So, the expression has 9 layers of 3*(...), so the outermost is Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3.\\n\\nWait, no. Wait, the expression is:\\n\\n3*(...), where inside the ... is another similar expression. So, the structure is recursive, with each step being 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\\n\\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572\\n\\nSo, total layers computed correctly.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a recurrence relation.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\\n\\nSo, a_1 = 4\\n\\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\\n\\na_7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\\n\\na_8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\\n\\na_9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\\n\\nGiven the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\\n\\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\\n\\nWe can solve it as follows:\\n\\nFirst, write the homogeneous recurrence:\\n\\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\\n\\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\\n\\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n\\n\\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\\n\\nAssume a_p = C.\\n\\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\\n\\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\\n\\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\\n\\nApply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\\n\\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\\n\\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\n\\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\n\\nTherefore, for n = 9:\\n\\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524\\n\\nWhich matches our previous computation.\\n\\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29,524) = 88,572\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\\n\\nI think that's solid. I computed each layer step by step, verified the recurrence relation, solved it, and got the same result. So, I'm confident the answer is 88,572.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer consists of 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times the next inner expression). Starting from the innermost part, we compute each layer step by step:\\n\\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\\n2. Substitute and compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result)\\n4. After computing all layers, multiply the final result by 3\\n\\nFollowing this method, we find that the value of the innermost expression after 9 layers is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\\n\\n3 * 29,524 = 88,572\\n\\n**Answer:** \\\\boxed{88572}\",\n",

Let me write that down:\\n\\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that:\\n\\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nAlright, so now we have 13. Next layer out is again 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So:\\n\\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nHmm, 40. Moving one more layer out, it's 1 + 3*40. Let's see:\\n\\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nWait, 121. Interesting, that's a square number. Let's keep going.\\n\\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nOkay, 364. Next one is 1 + 3*364.\\n\\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\nHmm, 1,093. Let me verify that multiplication: 3*364 is 1,092, right? Yep, adding 1 makes it 1,093.\\n\\nMoving outward again, it's 1 + 3*1,093.\\n\\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\nWait, 3*1,093 is 3,279, so adding 1 is 3,280. Okay, that seems correct.\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3,280.\\n\\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\nAlright, 9,841. Let me check that multiplication: 3*3,280 is indeed 9,840, so adding 1 gives 9,841.\\n\\nMoving outward, it's 1 + 3*9,841.\\n\\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n\\nOkay, 29,524. Next layer: 1 + 3*29,524.\\n\\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29,524 = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573\\n\\nHmm, 88,572 times 3 is 265,716, right? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, 29,524 * 3 is 88,572, so adding 1 gives 88,573. Okay, that's correct.\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*88,573.\\n\\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88,573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720\\n\\nWait, let me verify: 88,573 * 3. 80,000*3 is 240,000, 8,573*3 is 25,719. So, 240,000 + 25,719 is 265,719. Adding 1 gives 265,720. That's correct.\\n\\nMoving outward, it's 1 + 3*265,720.\\n\\n12. Next: 1 + 3*265,720 = 1 + 797,160 = 797,161\\n\\nAlright, 797,161. Next layer: 1 + 3*797,161.\\n\\n13. Next: 1 + 3*797,161 = 1 + 2,391,483 = 2,391,484\\n\\nLet me double-check that multiplication: 797,161 * 3. 700,000*3 is 2,100,000, 97,161*3 is 291,483. Adding those together: 2,100,000 + 291,483 is 2,391,483. Adding 1 gives 2,391,484. Correct.\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*2,391,484.\\n\\n14. Next: 1 + 3*2,391,484 = 1 + 7,174,452 = 7,174,453\\n\\nAlright, 7,174,453. Let me check: 2,391,484 * 3. 2,000,000*3 is 6,000,000, 391,484*3 is 1,174,452. So, 6,000,000 + 1,174,452 is 7,174,452. Adding 1 gives 7,174,453. Correct.\\n\\nMoving outward, it's 1 + 3*7,174,453.\\n\\n15. Next: 1 + 3*7,174,453 = 1 + 21,523,359 = 21,523,360\\n\\nWait, 7,174,453 * 3. Let's compute: 7,000,000*3 is 21,000,000, 174,453*3 is 523,359. Adding those: 21,000,000 + 523,359 is 21,523,359. Adding 1 gives 21,523,360. That's correct.\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*21,523,360.\\n\\n16. Next: 1 + 3*21,523,360 = 1 + 64,570,080 = 64,570,081\\n\\nAlright, 64,570,081. Let me verify: 21,523,360 * 3. 20,000,000*3 is 60,000,000, 1,523,360*3 is 4,570,080. Adding those: 60,000,000 + 4,570,080 is 64,570,080. Adding 1 gives 64,570,081. Correct.\\n\\nMoving outward, it's 1 + 3*64,570,081.\\n\\n17. Next: 1 + 3*64,570,081 = 1 + 193,710,243 = 193,710,244\\n\\nHmm, 64,570,081 * 3. Let me compute: 60,000,000*3 is 180,000,000, 4,570,081*3 is 13,710,243. Adding those: 180,000,000 + 13,710,243 is 193,710,243. Adding 1 gives 193,710,244. Correct.\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*193,710,244.\\n\\n18. Next: 1 + 3*193,710,244 = 1 + 581,130,732 = 581,130,733\\n\\nAlright, 581,130,733. Let me check: 193,710,244 * 3. 190,000,000*3 is 570,000,000, 3,710,244*3 is 11,130,732. Adding those: 570,000,000 + 11,130,732 is 581,130,732. Adding 1 gives 581,130,733. Correct.\\n\\nMoving outward, it's 1 + 3*581,130,733.\\n\\n19. Next: 1 + 3*581,130,733 = 1 + 1,743,392,199 = 1,743,392,200\\n\\nWait, 581,130,733 * 3. Let me compute: 500,000,000*3 is 1,500,000,000, 81,130,733*3 is 243,392,199. Adding those: 1,500,000,000 + 243,392,199 is 1,743,392,199. Adding 1 gives 1,743,392,200. Correct.\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1,743,392,200.\\n\\n20. Next: 1 + 3*1,743,392,200 = 1 + 5,230,176,600 = 5,230,176,601\\n\\nAlright, 5,230,176,601. Let me verify: 1,743,392,200 * 3. 1,700,000,000*3 is 5,100,000,000, 43,392,200*3 is 130,176,600. Adding those: 5,100,000,000 + 130,176,600 is 5,230,176,600. Adding 1 gives 5,230,176,601. Correct.\\n\\nSo, after computing all these layers step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, the final result is 5,230,176,601.\\n\\nBut wait a minute, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let me recap the computations:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n7. 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n8. 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n9. 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n10. 1 + 3*29,524 = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573\\n11. 1 + 3*88,573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720\\n12. 1 + 3*265,720 = 1 + 797,160 = 797,161\\n13. 1 + 3*797,161 = 1 + 2,391,483 = 2,391,484\\n14. 1 + 3*2,391,484 = 1 + 7,174,452 = 7,174,453\\n15. 1 + 3*7,174,453 = 1 + 21,523,359 = 21,523,360\\n16. 1 + 3*21,523,360 = 1 + 64,570,080 = 64,570,081\\n17. 1 + 3*64,570,081 = 1 + 193,710,243 = 193,710,244\\n18. 1 + 3*193,710,244 = 1 + 581,130,732 = 581,130,733\\n19. 1 + 3*581,130,733 = 1 + 1,743,392,199 = 1,743,392,200\\n20. 1 + 3*1,743,392,200 = 1 + 5,230,176,600 = 5,230,176,601\\n\\nYep, that seems consistent. Each step, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1, which is exactly what the problem is asking for. So, I think I did it right.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula here. Let me think about it. Each time, it's 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's like a recurrence relation. If I denote a\\u2099 as the nth term, then a\\u2099 = 3a\\u2099\\u208b\\u2081 + 1.\\n\\nStarting from a\\u2080 = 1, since the innermost is 1 + 3. Then a\\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, it's a linear recurrence.\\n\\nI remember that for such linear recurrences, the solution can be found using the formula:\\n\\na\\u2099 = (a\\u2080 * r\\u207f - 1) / (r - 1)\\n\\nwhere r is the common ratio, which in this case is 3.\\n\\nGiven that a\\u2080 = 1, the formula becomes:\\n\\na\\u2099 = (1 * 3\\u207f - 1) / (3 - 1) = (3\\u207f - 1) / 2\\n\\nSo, if I plug in n = 8, because there are 8 multiplications by 3, right? Wait, let me see. Starting from a\\u2080 as the first term, each step increases n by 1. So, if I have 8 layers, n would be 8.\\n\\nWait, but let's count the number of multiplications:\\n\\nEach time, we have 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from 1 + 3*4, that's one multiplication. Then 1 + 3*13, that's two. Continuing up to the outermost layer, which is 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\\n\\nLooking back at the original problem: the expression starts with 3(...), and inside there are 8 more layers: 1 + 3(...). Let me count:\\n\\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3(...)) is a layer. Let's see: the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the 1st layer. Then each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer. So, counting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result)\\n...\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7 result)\\nAnd then the outermost is 3*(Layer 8 result)\\n\\nSo, in total, there are 8 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then multiplied by 3 once more. So, the total number of multiplications by 3 is 8 + 1 = 9.\\n\\nWait, but in the recurrence, we started with a\\u2080 as 1, which is the innermost 1 + 3 = 4. So, a\\u2080 = 4? Hmm, maybe my initial mapping was off.\\n\\nLet me redefine. Let me consider the innermost term as a\\u2080, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is a\\u2081 = 1 + 3a\\u2080, a\\u2082 = 1 + 3a\\u2081, etc., up to a\\u2088, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\\n\\nSo, the total number of terms would be a\\u2080 to a\\u2088, which is 9 terms. So, n = 8.\\n\\nUsing the formula, a\\u2099 = (3\\u207f - 1)/2, so a\\u2088 = (3\\u2078 - 1)/2.\\n\\nCompute 3\\u2078: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561.\\n\\nSo, a\\u2088 = (6,561 - 1)/2 = 6,560 / 2 = 3,280.\\n\\nWait, but according to my step-by-step computation earlier, after 8 layers, the result was 3,280, which is then multiplied by 3 to get 9,841. But according to the formula, a\\u2088 is 3,280, which is the result after 8 layers. So, then the final result is 3 * a\\u2088 = 3 * 3,280 = 9,840. Wait, that contradicts my earlier result.\\n\\nWait, hold on. Maybe I'm confusing the formula. Let me clarify.\\n\\nIf a\\u2080 = 4, then a\\u2081 = 1 + 3a\\u2080 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\na\\u2082 = 1 + 3a\\u2081 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\na\\u2083 = 1 + 3a\\u2082 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\na\\u2084 = 1 + 3a\\u2083 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\na\\u2085 = 1 + 3a\\u2084 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\na\\u2086 = 1 + 3a\\u2085 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\na\\u2087 = 1 + 3a\\u2086 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\na\\u2088 = 1 + 3a\\u2087 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n\\nWait, so according to this, a\\u2088 is 29,524, which is the result after 8 layers. But in my initial step-by-step, I stopped at 5,230,176,601. Hmm, that's a big difference.\\n\\nWait, no, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the original expression.\\n\\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) inside the outermost 3(...). Starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3\\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\\n...\\nContinuing until the 8th layer:\\n\\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(that 8th layer). So, total layers including the outermost 3 are 8 + 1 = 9.\\n\\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I computed 20 layers, which doesn't make sense. I think I overcounted.\\n\\nWait, let me write the original expression with proper parentheses:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) inside the outermost 3(...). Starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. (1 + 3)\\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\\n...\\nContinuing until the 8th layer:\\n\\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(that 8th layer). So, total layers including the outermost 3 are 8 + 1 = 9.\\n\\nBut in my step-by-step, I computed 20 layers, which is incorrect. I think I miscounted the layers.\\n\\nWait, perhaps each time I did a step, I was only doing one layer, but the original expression has 8 layers inside, so 8 steps, and then multiplied by 3 once.\\n\\nSo, in the step-by-step, I did 8 multiplications by 3 and additions of 1, then the final multiplication by 3. So, total of 9 multiplications by 3.\\n\\nBut in the formula, if a\\u2080 is 1 (the innermost 1 + 3 = 4), then a\\u2081 is 13, a\\u2082 is 40, and so on until a\\u2088, which would be 29,524. Then, the final result is 3*a\\u2088 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, and then adding 1? Wait, no.\\n\\nWait, no, the formula gives a\\u2099 as the result after n layers, so a\\u2088 would be the result after 8 layers, which is 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572, and then adding 1? No, wait, the outermost is 3*(...), so it's 3*a\\u2088, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nBut in my step-by-step earlier, I went all the way up to 5,230,176,601. That must be wrong. I think I confused the number of layers.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: If the innermost is a\\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each a\\u2099 = 1 + 3a\\u2099\\u208b\\u2081. So, a\\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a\\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a\\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, a\\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364, a\\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093, a\\u2086 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280, a\\u2087 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841, a\\u2088 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\\n\\nSo, a\\u2088 is 29,524, which is the result after 8 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\\u2088 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nBut in my step-by-step earlier, I went up to 5,230,176,601, which is way larger. So, I think I miscounted the number of layers.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I considered each \\\"1 + 3(...)\\\" as a separate layer, but actually, each time I did a step, I was adding another layer, but the original problem only has 8 layers, so only 8 steps. Therefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I considered more layers than there actually are.\\n\\nSo, correcting that, let's do it properly with the correct number of layers.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. a\\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. a\\u2081 = 1 + 3*a\\u2080 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. a\\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\\u2081 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. a\\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\\u2082 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. a\\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\\u2083 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. a\\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\\u2084 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\n7. a\\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\\u2085 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\n8. a\\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\\u2086 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\n9. a\\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\\u2087 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\\u2088 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nWait, so that's different from my initial computation. So, I think my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I miscounted the number of layers.\\n\\nBut hold on, in the original problem, the expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) inside the outermost 3(...). Starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. (1 + 3)\\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\\n...\\nContinuing until the 8th layer:\\n\\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\\n\\nSo, 8 layers inside the outermost 3(...). Therefore, the total number of layers is 8, which would mean n = 8 in the formula.\\n\\nBut according to the formula, a\\u2088 = (3\\u2078 - 1)/2 = (6,561 - 1)/2 = 6,560 / 2 = 3,280. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\\u2088 = 3*3,280 = 9,840.\\n\\nBut wait, that contradicts the previous computation where a\\u2088 was 29,524. So, I think my confusion arises from how I'm defining a\\u2080.\\n\\nIn the formula, a\\u2099 = (3\\u207f - 1)/2, starting from a\\u2080 = 1. But in our case, the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4, which is a\\u2080 = 4.\\n\\nSo, if a\\u2080 = 4, then a\\u2081 = 1 + 3*a\\u2080 = 13, a\\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\\u2081 = 40, and so on, up to a\\u2088 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\\u2088 = 88,572.\\n\\nBut according to the formula, if a\\u2080 = 1, then a\\u2099 = (3\\u207f - 1)/2. So, if I want to get the same result, I need to adjust the formula.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula applies when starting from a\\u2080 = 1, but in our case, we start from a\\u2080 = 4.\\n\\nTherefore, the formula doesn't directly apply unless we adjust the initial term.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of multiplications is different.\\n\\nWait, maybe the formula is a\\u2099 = 3\\u207f - 1, but that doesn't align with our computations.\\n\\nWait, let me think differently. Let's model this as a geometric series.\\n\\nEach time, we have a term a\\u2099 = 1 + 3a\\u2099\\u208b\\u2081. This is a linear recurrence relation.\\n\\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a\\u2099 = C*3\\u207f + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\\n\\nGiven a\\u2080 = 4, then:\\n\\na\\u2080 = C*3\\u2070 + D = C + D = 4\\n\\na\\u2081 = C*3\\u00b9 + D = 3C + D = 13\\n\\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: (3C + D) - (C + D) = 2C = 13 - 4 = 9 => C = 4.5\\n\\nThen, from C + D = 4 => 4.5 + D = 4 => D = -0.5\\n\\nSo, the general solution is a\\u2099 = 4.5*3\\u207f - 0.5\\n\\nWe can write this as a\\u2099 = (9*3\\u207f - 1)/2\\n\\nTherefore, for n = 8, a\\u2088 = (9*3\\u2078 - 1)/2 = (9*6,561 - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524\\n\\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, a\\u2088 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\\u2088 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, in the formula, a\\u2099 is the result after n layers, starting from a\\u2080 = 4. So, for n = 8, a\\u2088 = 29,524. Then, multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\\n\\nBut according to the original problem, the entire expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nWhich is 3 times the 8th layer, which is 29,524, so 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88,572.\\n\\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went all the way to 5,230,176,601, which is way too large. That must be wrong because I miscounted the number of layers.\\n\\nWait, but looking back, the original problem has 8 layers inside the outermost 3(...), so only 8 steps, resulting in a\\u2088 = 29,524, then multiplied by 3 is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, in the initial problem, the outermost is 3(...), which is 3*(1 + 3(...8 times...)). So, that's 3 multiplied by the 8th layer, which is 29,524, so 3*29,524 is 88,572.\\n\\nSo, I think my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I considered more layers than there actually are. The correct number of layers is 8, resulting in 29,524, then multiplied by 3 is 88,572.\\n\\nBut let me verify again by expanding the expression step by step correctly.\\n\\nStarting with the innermost:\\n\\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\\n\\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\\n\\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\\n\\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, earlier I thought the formula gives a\\u2099 = (9*3\\u207f - 1)/2, which for n = 8 is 29,524, which is the result after 8 layers. Then, multiplied by 3 is 88,572.\\n\\nAlternatively, if we consider the entire expression as starting from a\\u2080 = 1, then the formula a\\u2099 = (3\\u207f - 1)/2 would give us a\\u2088 = (3\\u2078 - 1)/2 = (6,561 - 1)/2 = 6,560 / 2 = 3,280, which is different.\\n\\nWait, so perhaps the formula is applicable if we start from a\\u2080 = 1, but in our case, the innermost term is a\\u2080 = 4. Therefore, the formula doesn't directly apply unless we adjust for the initial term.\\n\\nAlternatively, we can see that the recurrence a\\u2099 = 1 + 3a\\u2099\\u208b\\u2081 with a\\u2080 = 4 leads to a\\u2099 = (9*3\\u207f - 1)/2, as we derived earlier.\\n\\nSo, for n = 8, a\\u2088 = (9*3\\u2078 - 1)/2 = (9*6,561 - 1)/2 = 59,049 - 1 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Then, 3*a\\u2088 = 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond 8 layers, which was incorrect. I think I confused the number of layers with the number of multiplications.\\n\\nSo, to summarize:\\n\\n- The original expression has 8 layers of (1 + 3(...)), starting from the innermost.\\n- Each layer is computed as a\\u2099 = 1 + 3a\\u2099\\u208b\\u2081, starting from a\\u2080 = 4.\\n- After 8 layers, we get a\\u2088 = 29,524.\\n- The entire expression is 3*a\\u2088 = 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. Let me compute the expression step by step, counting the layers correctly.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\n7. 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\n8. 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\n9. 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n\\nThen, the outermost is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\\n\\nI think my initial confusion was due to miscounting the number of layers. Once I correctly identified that there are 8 layers inside the outermost 3(...), I could apply the recurrence relation properly and arrive at the correct result.\\n\\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and cross-verifying with the recurrence relation and the formula, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe computed value is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\\n\\n\\\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\]\\n\\nWe start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outwards.

It looks pretty complicated at first glance, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it won't be so bad. Let me see... It's a series of nested expressions, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Hmm, this seems recursive or something. Maybe I can work from the inside out.\\n\\nOkay, starting with the innermost part: 1 + 3. That should be straightforward. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Let me write that down:\\n\\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4.

Let me compute: 500,000,000*3 is 1,500,000,000, 81,130,733*3 is 243,392,199. Adding those: 1,500,000,000 + 243,392,199 is 1,743,392,199. Adding 1 gives 1,743,392,200. Correct.\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1,743,392,200.\\n\\n20. Next: 1 + 3*1,743,392,200 = 1 + 5,230,176,600 = 5,230,176,601\\n\\nAlright, 5,230,176,601. Let me verify: 1,743,392,200 * 3. 1,700,000,000*3 is 5,100,000,000, 43,392,200*3 is 130,176,600. Adding those: 5,100,000,000 + 130,176,600 is 5,230,176,600. Adding 1 gives 5,230,176,601. Correct.\\n\\nSo, after computing all these layers step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, the final result is 5,230,176,601.\\n\\nBut wait a minute, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let me recap the computations:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n7. 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n8. 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n9. 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n10. 1 + 3*29,524 = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573\\n11. 1 + 3*88,573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720\\n12. 1 + 3*265,720 = 1 + 797,160 = 797,161\\n13. 1 + 3*797,161 = 1 + 2,391,483 = 2,391,484\\n14. 1 + 3*2,391,484 = 1 + 7,174,452 = 7,174,453\\n15. 1 + 3*7,174,453 = 1 + 21,523,359 = 21,523,360\\n16. 1 + 3*21,523,360 = 1 + 64,570,080 = 64,570,081\\n17. 1 + 3*64,570,081 = 1 + 193,710,243 = 193,710,244\\n18. 1 + 3*193,710,244 = 1 + 581,130,732 = 581,130,733\\n19. 1 + 3*581,130,733 = 1 + 1,743,392,199 = 1,743,392,200\\n20. 1 + 3*1,743,392,200 = 1 + 5,230,176,600 = 5,230,176,601\\n\\nYep, that seems consistent. Each step, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1, which is exactly what the problem is asking for. So, I think I did it right.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula here. Let me think about it. Each time, it's 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's like a recurrence relation. If I denote a\\u2099 as the nth term, then a\\u2099 = 3a\\u2099\\u208b\\u2081 + 1.\\n\\nStarting from a\\u2080 = 1, since the innermost is 1 + 3. Then a\\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, it's a linear recurrence.\\n\\nI remember that for such linear recurrences, the solution can be found using the formula:\\n\\na\\u2099 = (a\\u2080 * r\\u207f - 1) / (r - 1)\\n\\nwhere r is the common ratio, which in this case is 3.\\n\\nGiven that a\\u2080 = 1, the formula becomes:\\n\\na\\u2099 = (1 * 3\\u207f - 1) / (3 - 1) = (3\\u207f - 1) / 2\\n\\nSo, if I plug in n = 8, because there are 8 multiplications by 3, right? Wait, let me see. Starting from a\\u2080 as the first term, each step increases n by 1. So, if I have 8 layers, n would be 8.\\n\\nWait, but let's count the number of multiplications:\\n\\nEach time, we have 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from 1 + 3*4, that's one multiplication. Then 1 + 3*13, that's two. Continuing up to the outermost layer, which is 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\\n\\nLooking back at the original problem: the expression starts with 3(...), and inside there are 8 more layers: 1 + 3(...). Let me count:\\n\\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3(...)) is a layer. Let's see: the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the 1st layer. Then each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer. So, counting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result)\\n...\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7 result)\\nAnd then the outermost is 3*(Layer 8 result)\\n\\nSo, in total, there are 8 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then multiplied by 3 once more. So, the total number of multiplications by 3 is 8 + 1 = 9.\\n\\nWait, but in the recurrence, we started with a\\u2080 as 1, which is the innermost 1 + 3 = 4. So, a\\u2080 = 4? Hmm, maybe my initial mapping was off.\\n\\nLet me redefine. Let me consider the innermost term as a\\u2080, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is a\\u2081 = 1 + 3a\\u2080, a\\u2082 = 1 + 3a\\u2081, etc., up to a\\u2088, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\\n\\nSo, the total number of terms would be a\\u2080 to a\\u2088, which is 9 terms. So, n = 8.\\n\\nUsing the formula, a\\u2099 = (3\\u207f - 1)/2, so a\\u2088 = (3\\u2078 - 1)/2.\\n\\nCompute 3\\u2078: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561.\\n\\nSo, a\\u2088 = (6,561 - 1)/2 = 6,560 / 2 = 3,280.\\n\\nWait, but according to my step-by-step computation earlier, after 8 layers, the result was 3,280, which is then multiplied by 3 to get 9,841. But according to the formula, a\\u2088 is 3,280, which is the result after 8 layers. So, then the final result is 3 * a\\u2088 = 3 * 3,280 = 9,840. Wait, that contradicts my earlier result.\\n\\nWait, hold on. Maybe I'm confusing the formula. Let me clarify.\\n\\nIf a\\u2080 = 4, then a\\u2081 = 1 + 3a\\u2080 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\na\\u2082 = 1 + 3a\\u2081 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\na\\u2083 = 1 + 3a\\u2082 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\na\\u2084 = 1 + 3a\\u2083 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\na\\u2085 = 1 + 3a\\u2084 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\na\\u2086 = 1 + 3a\\u2085 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\na\\u2087 = 1 + 3a\\u2086 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\na\\u2088 = 1 + 3a\\u2087 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n\\nWait, so according to this, a\\u2088 is 29,524, which is the result after 8 layers. But in my initial step-by-step, I stopped at 5,230,176,601. Hmm, that's a big difference.\\n\\nWait, no, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the original expression.\\n\\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) inside the outermost 3(...). Starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3\\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\\n...\\nContinuing until the 8th layer:\\n\\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(that 8th layer). So, total layers including the outermost 3 are 8 + 1 = 9.\\n\\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I computed 20 layers, which doesn't make sense. I think I overcounted.\\n\\nWait, let me write the original expression with proper parentheses:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) inside the outermost 3(...). Starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. (1 + 3)\\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\\n...\\nContinuing until the 8th layer:\\n\\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(that 8th layer). So, total layers including the outermost 3 are 8 + 1 = 9.\\n\\nBut in my step-by-step, I computed 20 layers, which is incorrect. I think I miscounted the layers.\\n\\nWait, perhaps each time I did a step, I was only doing one layer, but the original expression has 8 layers inside, so 8 steps, and then multiplied by 3 once.\\n\\nSo, in the step-by-step, I did 8 multiplications by 3 and additions of 1, then the final multiplication by 3. So, total of 9 multiplications by 3.\\n\\nBut in the formula, if a\\u2080 is 1 (the innermost 1 + 3 = 4), then a\\u2081 is 13, a\\u2082 is 40, and so on until a\\u2088, which would be 29,524. Then, the final result is 3*a\\u2088 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, and then adding 1? Wait, no.\\n\\nWait, no, the formula gives a\\u2099 as the result after n layers, so a\\u2088 would be the result after 8 layers, which is 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572, and then adding 1? No, wait, the outermost is 3*(...), so it's 3*a\\u2088, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nBut in my step-by-step earlier, I went all the way up to 5,230,176,601. That must be wrong. I think I confused the number of layers.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: If the innermost is a\\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each a\\u2099 = 1 + 3a\\u2099\\u208b\\u2081. So, a\\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a\\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a\\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, a\\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364, a\\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093, a\\u2086 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280, a\\u2087 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841, a\\u2088 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\\n\\nSo, a\\u2088 is 29,524, which is the result after 8 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\\u2088 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nBut in my step-by-step earlier, I went up to 5,230,176,601, which is way larger. So, I think I miscounted the number of layers.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I considered each \\\"1 + 3(...)\\\" as a separate layer, but actually, each time I did a step, I was adding another layer, but the original problem only has 8 layers, so only 8 steps. Therefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I considered more layers than there actually are.\\n\\nSo, correcting that, let's do it properly with the correct number of layers.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. a\\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. a\\u2081 = 1 + 3*a\\u2080 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. a\\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\\u2081 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. a\\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\\u2082 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. a\\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\\u2083 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. a\\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\\u2084 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\n7. a\\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\\u2085 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\n8. a\\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\\u2086 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\n9. a\\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\\u2087 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\\u2088 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nWait, so that's different from my initial computation. So, I think my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I miscounted the number of layers.\\n\\nBut hold on, in the original problem, the expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) inside the outermost 3(...). Starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. (1 + 3)\\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\\n...\\nContinuing until the 8th layer:\\n\\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\\n\\nSo, 8 layers inside the outermost 3(...). Therefore, the total number of layers is 8, which would mean n = 8 in the formula.\\n\\nBut according to the formula, a\\u2088 = (3\\u2078 - 1)/2 = (6,561 - 1)/2 = 6,560 / 2 = 3,280. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\\u2088 = 3*3,280 = 9,840.\\n\\nBut wait, that contradicts the previous computation where a\\u2088 was 29,524. So, I think my confusion arises from how I'm defining a\\u2080.\\n\\nIn the formula, a\\u2099 = (3\\u207f - 1)/2, starting from a\\u2080 = 1. But in our case, the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4, which is a\\u2080 = 4.\\n\\nSo, if a\\u2080 = 4, then a\\u2081 = 1 + 3*a\\u2080 = 13, a\\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\\u2081 = 40, and so on, up to a\\u2088 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\\u2088 = 88,572.\\n\\nBut according to the formula, if a\\u2080 = 1, then a\\u2099 = (3\\u207f - 1)/2. So, if I want to get the same result, I need to adjust the formula.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula applies when starting from a\\u2080 = 1, but in our case, we start from a\\u2080 = 4.\\n\\nTherefore, the formula doesn't directly apply unless we adjust the initial term.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of multiplications is different.\\n\\nWait, maybe the formula is a\\u2099 = 3\\u207f - 1, but that doesn't align with our computations.\\n\\nWait, let me think differently. Let's model this as a geometric series.\\n\\nEach time, we have a term a\\u2099 = 1 + 3a\\u2099\\u208b\\u2081. This is a linear recurrence relation.\\n\\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a\\u2099 = C*3\\u207f + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\\n\\nGiven a\\u2080 = 4, then:\\n\\na\\u2080 = C*3\\u2070 + D = C + D = 4\\n\\na\\u2081 = C*3\\u00b9 + D = 3C + D = 13\\n\\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: (3C + D) - (C + D) = 2C = 13 - 4 = 9 => C = 4.5\\n\\nThen, from C + D = 4 => 4.5 + D = 4 => D = -0.5\\n\\nSo, the general solution is a\\u2099 = 4.5*3\\u207f - 0.5\\n\\nWe can write this as a\\u2099 = (9*3\\u207f - 1)/2\\n\\nTherefore, for n = 8, a\\u2088 = (9*3\\u2078 - 1)/2 = (9*6,561 - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524\\n\\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, a\\u2088 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\\u2088 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, in the formula, a\\u2099 is the result after n layers, starting from a\\u2080 = 4. So, for n = 8, a\\u2088 = 29,524. Then, multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\\n\\nBut according to the original problem, the entire expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nWhich is 3 times the 8th layer, which is 29,524, so 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88,572.\\n\\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went all the way to 5,230,176,601, which is way too large. That must be wrong because I miscounted the number of layers.\\n\\nWait, but looking back, the original problem has 8 layers inside the outermost 3(...), so only 8 steps, resulting in a\\u2088 = 29,524, then multiplied by 3 is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, in the initial problem, the outermost is 3(...), which is 3*(1 + 3(...8 times...)). So, that's 3 multiplied by the 8th layer, which is 29,524, so 3*29,524 is 88,572.\\n\\nSo, I think my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I considered more layers than there actually are. The correct number of layers is 8, resulting in 29,524, then multiplied by 3 is 88,572.\\n\\nBut let me verify again by expanding the expression step by step correctly.\\n\\nStarting with the innermost:\\n\\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\\n\\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\\n\\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\\n\\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, earlier I thought the formula gives a\\u2099 = (9*3\\u207f - 1)/2, which for n = 8 is 29,524, which is the result after 8 layers. Then, multiplied by 3 is 88,572.\\n\\nAlternatively, if we consider the entire expression as starting from a\\u2080 = 1, then the formula a\\u2099 = (3\\u207f - 1)/2 would give us a\\u2088 = (3\\u2078 - 1)/2 = (6,561 - 1)/2 = 6,560 / 2 = 3,280, which is different.\\n\\nWait, so perhaps the formula is applicable if we start from a\\u2080 = 1, but in our case, the innermost term is a\\u2080 = 4. Therefore, the formula doesn't directly apply unless we adjust for the initial term.\\n\\nAlternatively, we can see that the recurrence a\\u2099 = 1 + 3a\\u2099\\u208b\\u2081 with a\\u2080 = 4 leads to a\\u2099 = (9*3\\u207f - 1)/2, as we derived earlier.\\n\\nSo, for n = 8, a\\u2088 = (9*3\\u2078 - 1)/2 = (9*6,561 - 1)/2 = 59,049 - 1 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Then, 3*a\\u2088 = 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond 8 layers, which was incorrect. I think I confused the number of layers with the number of multiplications.\\n\\nSo, to summarize:\\n\\n- The original expression has 8 layers of (1 + 3(...)), starting from the innermost.\\n- Each layer is computed as a\\u2099 = 1 + 3a\\u2099\\u208b\\u2081, starting from a\\u2080 = 4.\\n- After 8 layers, we get a\\u2088 = 29,524.\\n- The entire expression is 3*a\\u2088 = 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. Let me compute the expression step by step, counting the layers correctly.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\n7. 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\n8. 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\n9. 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n\\nThen, the outermost is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\\n\\nI think my initial confusion was due to miscounting the number of layers. Once I correctly identified that there are 8 layers inside the outermost 3(...), I could apply the recurrence relation properly and arrive at the correct result.\\n\\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and cross-verifying with the recurrence relation and the formula, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe computed value is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\\n\\n\\\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\]\\n\\nWe start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outwards. Each step involves computing the expression inside the parentheses and then multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\\n\\n1. Innermost expression: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n2. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n3. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n4. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n5.

I think I need to break it down step by step. Let me see... It's a product of 3's multiplied by a series of nested expressions. Each expression inside the parentheses seems to follow the pattern 1 + 3(something). Maybe if I work from the innermost parentheses outward, it will make more sense.\\n\\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nStarting from the innermost part, I'll compute each layer one by one. Let's count how many layers there are. It seems like there are 9 layers of parentheses. Wait, let me check that: starting from the innermost, each time I open a parenthesis, I go deeper. So, let's count:\\n\\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\\n...\\n9. Up to the outermost: 3(1 + 3(...)) with 8 more layers.\\n\\nBut actually, let me see: the expression starts with 3 multiplied by something, which is 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps another 1 + 3(...). How many layers are there?\\n\\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the beginning:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, each \\\"1 + 3(\\\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \\\"1 + 3(\\\" after the first 3:\\n\\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)\\n2. Then inside that, 1 + 3(...)\\n3. And so on, until the innermost 1 + 3.\\n\\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I can compute each step.\\n\\nMaybe it's easier if I write out each step:\\n\\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me denote S_n as the expression starting from the nth layer.\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost:\\n\\nS_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen,\\n\\nS_2 = 1 + 3(S_1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nS_3 = 1 + 3(S_2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nS_4 = 1 + 3(S_3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nS_5 = 1 + 3(S_4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nS_6 = 1 + 3(S_5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nS_7 = 1 + 3(S_6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nS_8 = 1 + 3(S_7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nS_9 = 1 + 3(S_8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 multiplied by all these. So, the entire expression is 3*(S_9). So, let me compute that.\\n\\nTotal = 3 * 29524\\n\\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\\n\\n29524 * 3:\\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\\n- 24 * 3 = 72\\n\\nAdding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\\n\\nSo, the total is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check my S_n calculations because that seems like a lot, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nS_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nS_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nS_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nS_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nS_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nS_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nS_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nS_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nS_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So, S_9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something.\\n\\nLooking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for a linear recurrence.\\n\\nThe general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is the constant term and r is the multiplier.\\n\\nIn this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c = 1, r = 3.\\n\\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions.\\n\\nWait, but since r = 3, which is greater than 1, the solution will be a_n = A*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = A*3^n - 1/2.\\n\\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\\n\\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\\n\\nTherefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\\n\\nSo, for n layers, starting from n=1:\\n\\na_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\\n\\na_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\\n\\na_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches.\\n\\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, for S_9, which is a_9, we can compute it as:\\n\\na_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\\n\\nWhich is the same as before. So, the 9th term is 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can see the entire expression as a product of 3's and 1's, but it's more complicated.\\n\\nAlternatively, think of it as a geometric series with ratio 3. Each time you go deeper, it's multiplied by 3.\\n\\nWait, another approach: Let me write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a geometric progression but with each term being 1 + 3*previous.\\n\\nAlternatively, let me represent it as a continued multiplication.\\n\\nWait, but perhaps my initial step-by-step approach is the most straightforward, and I already arrived at 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure.\\n\\n29524 * 3:\\n\\n29524 * 3:\\n\\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\\n\\n- 9000 * 3 = 27,000\\n\\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\\n\\n- 24 * 3 = 72\\n\\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3^9 multiplied by some factor.\\n\\nWait, but given the recursion a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the closed-form is (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, no, earlier we had a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\\n\\nWait, let me check:\\n\\nWe had a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\\n\\nYes, so a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\\n\\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\\n\\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88,572.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step without using the formula:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572\\n\\nYes, same result.\\n\\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe computed value is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\\n\\n\\\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\]\\n\\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

I think I need to break it down step by step. Let me see... It's a product of 3's multiplied by a series of nested expressions. Each expression inside the parentheses seems to follow the pattern 1 + 3(something). Maybe if I work from the innermost parentheses outward, it will make more sense.\\n\\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nStarting from the innermost part, I'll compute each layer one by one. Let's count how many layers there are. It seems like there are 9 layers of parentheses. Wait, let me check that: starting from the innermost, each time I open a parenthesis, I go deeper. So, let's count:\\n\\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\\n...\\n9. Up to the outermost: 3(1 + 3(...)) with 8 more layers.\\n\\nBut actually, let me see: the expression starts with 3 multiplied by something, which is 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps another 1 + 3(...). How many layers are there?\\n\\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the beginning:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, each \\\"1 + 3(\\\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \\\"1 + 3(\\\" after the first 3:\\n\\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)\\n2. Then inside that, 1 + 3(...)\\n3. And so on, until the innermost 1 + 3.\\n\\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I can compute each step.\\n\\nMaybe it's easier if I write out each step:\\n\\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me denote S_n as the expression starting from the nth layer.\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost:\\n\\nS_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen,\\n\\nS_2 = 1 + 3(S_1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nS_3 = 1 + 3(S_2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nS_4 = 1 + 3(S_3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nS_5 = 1 + 3(S_4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nS_6 = 1 + 3(S_5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nS_7 = 1 + 3(S_6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nS_8 = 1 + 3(S_7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nS_9 = 1 + 3(S_8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 multiplied by all these. So, the entire expression is 3*(S_9). So, let me compute that.\\n\\nTotal = 3 * 29524\\n\\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\\n\\n29524 * 3:\\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\\n- 24 * 3 = 72\\n\\nAdding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\\n\\nSo, the total is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check my S_n calculations because that seems like a lot, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nS_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nS_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nS_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nS_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nS_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nS_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nS_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nS_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nS_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So, S_9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something.\\n\\nLooking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for a linear recurrence.\\n\\nThe general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is the constant term and r is the multiplier.\\n\\nIn this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c = 1, r = 3.\\n\\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions.\\n\\nWait, but since r = 3, which is greater than 1, the solution will be a_n = A*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = A*3^n - 1/2.\\n\\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\\n\\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\\n\\nTherefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\\n\\nSo, for n layers, starting from n=1:\\n\\na_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\\n\\na_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\\n\\na_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches.\\n\\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, for S_9, which is a_9, we can compute it as:\\n\\na_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\\n\\nWhich is the same as before. So, the 9th term is 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can see the entire expression as a product of 3's and 1's, but it's more complicated.\\n\\nAlternatively, think of it as a geometric series with ratio 3. Each time you go deeper, it's multiplied by 3.\\n\\nWait, another approach: Let me write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a geometric progression but with each term being 1 + 3*previous.\\n\\nAlternatively, let me represent it as a continued multiplication.\\n\\nWait, but perhaps my initial step-by-step approach is the most straightforward, and I already arrived at 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure.\\n\\n29524 * 3:\\n\\n29524 * 3:\\n\\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\\n\\n- 9000 * 3 = 27,000\\n\\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\\n\\n- 24 * 3 = 72\\n\\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3^9 multiplied by some factor.\\n\\nWait, but given the recursion a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the closed-form is (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, no, earlier we had a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\\n\\nWait, let me check:\\n\\nWe had a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\\n\\nYes, so a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\\n\\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\\n\\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88,572.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step without using the formula:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572\\n\\nYes, same result.\\n\\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe computed value is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\\n\\n\\\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\]\\n\\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me see:\\n\\nThe original expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen, the next one is:\\n\\n1 + 3*(result above) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nThen, moving out another level:\\n\\n1 + 3*(result above) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nWait, that seems off. Let me write this down step by step.\\n\\nLevel 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nLevel 10: 1 + 3*(Level 9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\n\\nLevel 11: 1 + 3*(Level 10) = 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\\n\\nLevel 12: 1 + 3*(Level 11) = 1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161\\n\\nWait, but the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Let me count:\\n\\nLooking at the original expression:\\n\\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after each 3: starting from the first 3, it's 1, then 2, up to 9. So, there are 9 levels.\\n\\nBut in my previous breakdown, I went up to Level 12, which is beyond 9. That must be incorrect.\\n\\nWait, maybe I overcounted. Let me try again.\\n\\nLet me write the expression with the number of parentheses:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4 (Level 1)\\n\\nThen, moving out:\\n\\n1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 12 = 13 (Level 2)\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 39 = 40 (Level 3)\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 120 = 121 (Level 4)\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 363 = 364 (Level 5)\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Level 6)\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Level 7)\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Level 8)\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Level 9)\\n\\nThen, finally, the outermost 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\\n\\nWait, that seems more accurate. So, each level is multiplied by 3, then 1 is added. Starting from 4, then 13, then 40, and so on, up to Level 9, which is 29524, and then the outermost operation is 3*(29524) = 88572.\\n\\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe I can write it out step by step.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. Compute 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. Compute 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. Compute 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. Compute 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. Compute 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. Compute 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\n7. Compute 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\n8.

Finally, compute 3*(29524) = 88572\\n\\nSo, the result is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, let me count the number of operations again. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so there should be 9 levels of computation before the outermost 3. Hmm, but in my step-by-step, I have 10 steps, which seems inconsistent.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the count is different. Let me parse the original expression again.\\n\\nOriginal expression:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nCount the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3\\n\\nThen, moving out:\\n\\n1 + 3(1 + 3)\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\\n\\nAnd so on, up to the outermost.\\n\\nLet me count how many 1 + 3(...) there are.\\n\\nEach opening parenthesis after a 3 corresponds to a new level.\\n\\nStarting from the first 3:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, after the first 3, there is a (1 + 3(...)), which is one level. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)):\\n\\n1. 1 + 3\\n\\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\\n\\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\\n\\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\\n\\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\\n\\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\\n\\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\\n\\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\\n\\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\\n\\nSo, there are 9 levels of 1 + 3(...). Therefore, starting from 1 + 3 = 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to 9 levels.\\n\\nBut in my previous step-by-step, I went up to 9 levels:\\n\\n1. 4\\n\\n2. 13\\n\\n3. 40\\n\\n4. 121\\n\\n5. 364\\n\\n6. 1093\\n\\n7. 3280\\n\\n8. 9841\\n\\n9. 29524\\n\\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(29524) = 88572\\n\\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error, let me verify each step:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. Each step follows from the previous one, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572.\\n\\nI think that's the right answer. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe expression is a nested sequence of operations starting from the innermost parentheses. By computing each level step by step, we find that the result is 88,572.\\n\\n**Answer:** \\\\boxed{88572}\",\n",

It looks a bit complicated with all those nested parentheses. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst off, I notice that the expression is built using multiple layers of 1+3 multiplied by 3. It starts with a single 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps around another 1+3 inside. So, it's like a repeated pattern: 1+3, then 1+3 multiplied by 3, and so on, nine times in total. That might be a helpful way to see it.\\n\\nMaybe I can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. Let me write this out step by step.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost part:\\n1. The innermost expression is \\\\(1 + 3\\\\). That equals 4.\\n2. The next layer is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3\\\\). Wait, no, actually, it's 3 times the previous result. Let me clarify: each layer is 3 multiplied by the result of the next layer. So, starting from the innermost:\\n   - Layer 1: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n   - Layer 2: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3) = 3 \\\\times 4 = 12\\\\)\\n   - Layer 3: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3 \\\\times 3) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 9) = 3 \\\\times 10 = 30\\\\)\\n   - Layer 4: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3 \\\\times 10) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 30) = 3 \\\\times 31 = 93\\\\)\\n   - Layer 5: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3 \\\\times 31) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 93) = 3 \\\\times 94 = 282\\\\)\\n   - Layer 6: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3 \\\\times 94) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 282) = 3 \\\\times 283 = 849\\\\)\\n   - Layer 7: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3 \\\\times 283) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 849) = 3 \\\\times 850 = 2550\\\\)\\n   - Layer 8: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3 \\\\times 850) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 2550) = 3 \\\\times 2551 = 7653\\\\)\\n   - Layer 9: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3 \\\\times 2551) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 7653) = 3 \\\\times 7654 = 22962\\\\)\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. So each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1, then multiplying by 3 again? Hmm, no, actually, looking back, I think I might have misinterpreted the structure.\\n\\nLet me parse the original expression again:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nSo, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... and so on, nine times). So each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. That means I should start from the innermost and work my way out.\\n\\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\\n\\n1. Innermost: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n2. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n3. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n4. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n5. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\)\\n6. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\)\\n7. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\)\\n8. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\)\\n9. Finally, the outermost layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\\\)\\n\\nWait, that seems different from my initial calculation. Let me check each step carefully.\\n\\nStarting with layer 1: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\). That's correct.\\n\\nLayer 2: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\). That's right.\\n\\nLayer 3: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLayer 4: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\). Okay.\\n\\nLayer 5: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\). Yep.\\n\\nLayer 6: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\). That's right.\\n\\nLayer 7: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLayer 8: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\). Yes.\\n\\nLayer 9: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\\\). That's the final result.\\n\\nWait, but in my first attempt, I had a different number at layer 3. Let me see why.\\n\\nIn my first step-by-step, I thought it was 3 multiplied by each previous result, but actually, it's 3 multiplied by the previous result, and then added to 1, then multiplied by 3 again. So, each step is 1 plus 3 times the previous step.\\n\\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4:\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nWait, but in my first calculation, I think I messed up the layers. So, perhaps the second approach is the correct one, leading to 29524 as the final answer.\\n\\nLet me verify this with a different method, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula.\\n\\nLooking at the layers:\\n\\nEach layer is of the form \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times \\\\text{previous layer}\\\\).\\n\\nSo, starting from layer 1: 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 29524.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define \\\\(a_n\\\\) where \\\\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\\\), and \\\\(a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n\\\\). Then, \\\\(a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\\\\), \\\\(a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\\\\), and so on, up to \\\\(a_9 = 29524\\\\). That seems to align with my calculations.\\n\\nWait, but another thought: Maybe I can express this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula instead of computing each layer step by step.\\n\\nThe recurrence relation \\\\(a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n\\\\) can be rewritten as \\\\(a_{n+1} - 3a_n = 1\\\\).

Problem: Compute\\n\\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ Solution: \\n<think>\\nAlright, so I have this math problem to solve: Compute \\\\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\\\). It looks a bit complicated with all those nested parentheses. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst off, I notice that the expression is built using multiple layers of 1+3 multiplied by 3. It starts with a single 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps around another 1+3 inside. So, it's like a repeated pattern: 1+3, then 1+3 multiplied by 3, and so on, nine times in total. That might be a helpful way to see it.\\n\\nMaybe I can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. Let me write this out step by step.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost part:\\n1. The innermost expression is \\\\(1 + 3\\\\). That equals 4.\\n2. The next layer is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3\\\\). Wait, no, actually, it's 3 times the previous result. Let me clarify: each layer is 3 multiplied by the result of the next layer. So, starting from the innermost:\\n   - Layer 1: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n   - Layer 2: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3) = 3 \\\\times 4 = 12\\\\)\\n   - Layer 3: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3 \\\\times 3) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 9) = 3 \\\\times 10 = 30\\\\)\\n   - Layer 4: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3 \\\\times 10) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 30) = 3 \\\\times 31 = 93\\\\)\\n   - Layer 5: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3 \\\\times 31) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 93) = 3 \\\\times 94 = 282\\\\)\\n   - Layer 6: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3 \\\\times 94) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 282) = 3 \\\\times 283 = 849\\\\)\\n   - Layer 7: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3 \\\\times 283) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 849) = 3 \\\\times 850 = 2550\\\\)\\n   - Layer 8: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3 \\\\times 850) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 2550) = 3 \\\\times 2551 = 7653\\\\)\\n   - Layer 9: \\\\(3 \\\\times (1 + 3 \\\\times 2551) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 7653) = 3 \\\\times 7654 = 22962\\\\)\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. So each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1, then multiplying by 3 again? Hmm, no, actually, looking back, I think I might have misinterpreted the structure.\\n\\nLet me parse the original expression again:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nSo, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... and so on, nine times). So each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. That means I should start from the innermost and work my way out.\\n\\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\\n\\n1. Innermost: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n2. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n3. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n4. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n5. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\)\\n6. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\)\\n7. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\)\\n8. Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\)\\n9. Finally, the outermost layer: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\\\)\\n\\nWait, that seems different from my initial calculation. Let me check each step carefully.\\n\\nStarting with layer 1: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\). That's correct.\\n\\nLayer 2: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\). That's right.\\n\\nLayer 3: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLayer 4: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\). Okay.\\n\\nLayer 5: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\). Yep.\\n\\nLayer 6: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\). That's right.\\n\\nLayer 7: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\). Correct.\\n\\nLayer 8: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\). Yes.\\n\\nLayer 9: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\\\). That's the final result.\\n\\nWait, but in my first attempt, I had a different number at layer 3. Let me see why.\\n\\nIn my first step-by-step, I thought it was 3 multiplied by each previous result, but actually, it's 3 multiplied by the previous result, and then added to 1, then multiplied by 3 again. So, each step is 1 plus 3 times the previous step.\\n\\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4:\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nWait, but in my first calculation, I think I messed up the layers. So, perhaps the second approach is the correct one, leading to 29524 as the final answer.\\n\\nLet me verify this with a different method, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula.\\n\\nLooking at the layers:\\n\\nEach layer is of the form \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times \\\\text{previous layer}\\\\).\\n\\nSo, starting from layer 1: 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 29524.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define \\\\(a_n\\\\) where \\\\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\\\), and \\\\(a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n\\\\). Then, \\\\(a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\\\\), \\\\(a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\\\\), and so on, up to \\\\(a_9 = 29524\\\\). That seems to align with my calculations.\\n\\nWait, but another thought: Maybe I can express this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula instead of computing each layer step by step.\\n\\nThe recurrence relation \\\\(a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n\\\\) can be rewritten as \\\\(a_{n+1} - 3a_n = 1\\\\). This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\\n\\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving \\\\(a_{n+1} - 3a_n = 0\\\\), which has the characteristic equation \\\\(r - 3 = 0\\\\), so \\\\(r = 3\\\\). Therefore, the homogeneous solution is \\\\(A \\\\times 3^n\\\\).\\n\\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution \\\\(a_p = C\\\\). Plugging into the recurrence:\\n\\n\\\\(C - 3C = 1\\\\) \\u21d2 \\\\(-2C = 1\\\\) \\u21d2 \\\\(C = -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nThus, the general solution is \\\\(a_n = A \\\\times 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nNow, applying the initial condition \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(4 = A \\\\times 3^1 - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\) \\u21d2 \\\\(4 = 3A - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\) \\u21d2 \\\\(3A = 4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{2}\\\\) \\u21d2 \\\\(A = \\\\frac{9}{6} = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\times 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nSo, for \\\\(n = 9\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(a_9 = \\\\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{59048}{2} = 29524\\\\).\\n\\nThat matches my earlier calculation. So, that's a more efficient way to compute it without stepping through each layer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is 29524.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe computed value is \\\\boxed{29524}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the expression \\\\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\\n\\n1.

Because each 3 is followed by another set of parentheses, and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, perhaps I have 9 layers, which would correspond to Layer 1 to Layer 9, and then the outermost 3*Layer9.\\n\\nWait, that might mean that Layer 1 is (1 + 3) = 4, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4=13, up to Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer8=29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29,524=88,572?

So, 88,573.\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*88,573 = 265,719.\\n\\nSo, earlier, I thought Layer 9 was 29,524, but actually, Layer 10 is 88,573, and then multiplied by 3 gives 265,719.\\n\\nBut in the initial count, I thought there were 10 layers, but actually, starting from (1 + 3) as Layer 1, then each subsequent is Layer 2 to Layer 9, and then the outermost is 3*Layer9. Wait, no, the outermost is 3*(Layer10). Wait, confusion here.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\\n\\nLet me write down the structure:\\n\\nStart with 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 =13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 39=40\\n\\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\\n\\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\\n\\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\\n\\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\\n\\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\\n\\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\\n\\nLayer10:1 +3*29524=88573\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer10=3*88573=265719.\\n\\nSo, total layers are 10.

      "    \"full_cot\": \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\\\boxed{}. Problem: Compute\\n\\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ Solution: \\n<think>\\nOkay, so I have this math problem to solve: Compute this expression step by step. The expression is a long nested one, starting with 3 and then a bunch of parentheses. It looks like this:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nHmm, that's a lot of parentheses! Let me try to break it down. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That usually helps with nested expressions.\\n\\nSo, the innermost part is at the very end: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\\n\\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so that part simplifies to 4.\\n\\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3(1 + 3). Wait, let me check. The expression is 3 times (1 + something). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another set of 3 times something).\\n\\nWait, maybe it's better to write out each step with numbers to keep track. Let me try numbering each layer.\\n\\nStarting from the inside:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. That's 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute that: 3*1093 is... 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is... 29,523, so 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n\\nLayer 10: 1 + 3(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*29,524. 3*29,524 is... let me compute 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. So, 1 + 88,572 = 88,573\\n\\nWait, but the original expression starts with 3 multiplied by all these layers. So, after computing Layer 10, which is 88,573, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, 3 * 88,573. Let me compute that.\\n\\n88,573 * 3: 80,000 * 3 = 240,000; 8,000 * 3 = 24,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 70 * 3 = 210; 3 * 3 = 9.\\n\\nAdding those up: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719.\\n\\nWait, but let me double-check my multiplication because that seems a bit high. Maybe I should do it step by step.\\n\\n88,573 * 3:\\n\\nStarting from the right:\\n\\n3 * 3 = 9, write down 9, carry over 0.\\n\\n3 * 7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\\n\\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\\n\\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\\n\\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\\n\\nBut since there are no more digits, write down the 2.\\n\\nSo, reading from top: 2, 6, 5, 7, 1, 9. So, 265,719. Okay, that's correct.\\n\\nWait, but hold on. Let me recount the layers because I might have miscounted.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\\n\\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\\n\\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\\n\\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\\n\\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\\n\\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\\n\\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\\n\\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\\n\\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524 (Layer 9)\\n\\n10. 1 + 3*29,524 = 88,573 (Layer 10)\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10) = 3*88,573 = 265,719.\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 265,719.\\n\\nBut let me check if I counted the layers correctly because sometimes when nesting is involved, it's easy to miscount.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\nThere are 9 sets of parentheses after the first 3. Wait, let me count the number of 3(...) parts.\\n\\nLooking at the original expression:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the first 3, and then each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let's count the number of 3(...) terms.\\n\\n1. 3(...)\\n2. 3(...)\\n3. 3(...)\\n4. 3(...)\\n5. 3(...)\\n6. 3(...)\\n7. 3(...)\\n8. 3(...)\\n9. 3(...)\\n\\nSo, there are 9 layers, right? Because each 3 is followed by another set of parentheses, and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, perhaps I have 9 layers, which would correspond to Layer 1 to Layer 9, and then the outermost 3*Layer9.\\n\\nWait, that might mean that Layer 1 is (1 + 3) = 4, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4=13, up to Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer8=29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29,524=88,572? Wait, no, 3*29,524 is 88,572? Wait, 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,524*3=28,572; total 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but earlier I computed 88,573. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation.\\n\\nWait, let's check Layer 9 again.\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841.\\n\\nCompute 3*9841: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3.\\n\\nSo, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\\n\\nThen, Layer 9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\\n\\nThen, Layer 10: 1 + 3*29,524.\\n\\nCompute 3*29,524: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,524*3=28,572; total 88,572.\\n\\nSo, Layer 10: 1 + 88,572 = 88,573.\\n\\nWait, so that's correct. So, 88,573.\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*88,573 = 265,719.\\n\\nSo, earlier, I thought Layer 9 was 29,524, but actually, Layer 10 is 88,573, and then multiplied by 3 gives 265,719.\\n\\nBut in the initial count, I thought there were 10 layers, but actually, starting from (1 + 3) as Layer 1, then each subsequent is Layer 2 to Layer 9, and then the outermost is 3*Layer9. Wait, no, the outermost is 3*(Layer10). Wait, confusion here.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\\n\\nLet me write down the structure:\\n\\nStart with 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 =13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 39=40\\n\\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\\n\\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\\n\\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\\n\\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\\n\\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\\n\\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\\n\\nLayer10:1 +3*29524=88573\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer10=3*88573=265719.\\n\\nSo, total layers are 10. So, starting from Layer1 to Layer10.\\n\\nSo, the final answer is 265,719.\\n\\nBut to make sure, let me compute it step by step without numbering.\\n\\nStarting with the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen, moving out:\\n\\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\\n\\nThen, 1 +3*40=121\\n\\nThen,1 +3*121=364\\n\\nThen,1 +3*364=1093\\n\\nThen,1 +3*1093=3280\\n\\nThen,1 +3*3280=9841\\n\\nThen,1 +3*9841=29524\\n\\nThen,1 +3*29524=88573\\n\\nFinally, 3*88573=265719.\\n\\nYes, that's consistent.\\n\\nSo, I think I've got it right. The final answer is 265,719.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{265719}\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

Let me check again. The original expression is:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nLet me count the number of nested layers.

Let's count the number of '3(' and the corresponding ')'. \\n\\nLooking at the expression:\\n\\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let's count the number of '1+3('.\\n\\n1. 1+3\\n2. 1+3(...)\\n3. 1+3(...)\\n4. 1+3(...)\\n5. 1+3(...)\\n6. 1+3(...)\\n7. 1+3(...)\\n8. 1+3(...)\\n9. 1+3(...)\\n\\nWait, actually, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me see:\\n\\nTotal layers (excluding the outermost 3(...)):\\n\\nEach \\\"1+3(\\\" is a new layer.

So total layers, including the outermost, is 10.\\n\\nWait, actually, each time we have a 1+3(....), that's a layer. So starting from the innermost, how many 1+3(...) do we have?\\n\\nLooking at the expression:\\n\\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3(...) is a layer.\\n\\nCounting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. 1+3\\n2. 1+3(...)\\n3. 1+3(...)\\n4. 1+3(...)\\n5. 1+3(...)\\n6. 1+3(...)\\n7. 1+3(...)\\n8. 1+3(...)\\n9. 1+3(...)\\n10. 1+3(...)\\n\\nWait, actually, I think it's 9 layers, because the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent is another layer. Let me check:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer9)\\n\\nBut wait, the original expression is:\\n\\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, and each time, another layer. Let me count the number of '1+3('.\\n\\nFrom the innermost:\\n\\n1. 1+3\\n2. 1+3(...)\\n3. 1+3(...)\\n4. 1+3(...)\\n5. 1+3(...)\\n6. 1+3(...)\\n7. 1+3(...)\\n8. 1+3(...)\\n9. 1+3(...)\\n\\nSo, that's 9 layers, and then the outermost is 3(...). So, total layers including the outermost is 10. But each time, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3(...), so 9 layers before the outermost 3(...).\\n\\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.\\n\\nEach time, we have a structure like 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous.\\n\\nSo, starting with the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13.\\n\\nThen, the next is 1 + 3*13 = 40.\\n\\nWait, earlier I got 40, but let me check:\\n\\nWait, earlier I thought I did 1 + 3*13, which is 40. Then, next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364, then 1 + 3*364 = 1093, then 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, then 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, then 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, then 1 + 3*29524 = 88573.\\n\\nWait, but how many times did I compute? Let's count:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\\n\\nSo, that's 10 layers, starting from the innermost. So, each step, we're doing 1 + 3*previous. So, that's 10 times.\\n\\nBut in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let's see:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer.\\n\\nThe expression is:\\n\\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\\n\\n1. 1+3\\n2. 1+3(...)\\n3. 1+3(...)\\n4. 1+3(...)\\n5. 1+3(...)\\n6. 1+3(...)\\n7. 1+3(...)\\n8. 1+3(...)\\n9. 1+3(...)\\n\\nSo, that's 9 layers, and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, total layers including the outermost is 10.\\n\\nBut in my previous calculation, I did 10 layers, starting from 1+3 up to 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. So, that would correspond to 10 layers.\\n\\nBut wait, the original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...), and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, actually, the total computation is 10 steps, but the expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 9 layers of 1+3(...).\\n\\nWait, no, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the ... is 8 layers, making it 9 layers in total. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\\n\\nLet me try to parse the expression again.\\n\\nThe original expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\\n10. 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\\n\\nSo, that's 10 layers, starting from the innermost. Then, the outermost is 3*(...), which would be 3*88573.\\n\\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so after computing all the inner layers, which is 9 layers, the result is 88573, and then multiplied by 3.\\n\\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I did 10 layers, starting from 1+3. So, perhaps I overcounted.\\n\\nWait, let me clarify:\\n\\nThe expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let's see:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\\n\\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\\n\\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer10) = 3*88573 = ?\\n\\nSo, 3*88573. Let me compute that.\\n\\nFirst, compute 88573 * 3.\\n\\nCompute 88573 * 3:\\n\\n70,000 * 3 = 210,000\\n\\nBut let me do it step by step.\\n\\n88,573 * 3:\\n\\n3 * 8 = 24, write down 4, carryover 2.\\n\\n3 * 7 = 21 + 2 = 23, write down 3, carryover 2.\\n\\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\\n\\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2.\\n\\n3 * 0 = 0 + 2 = 2.\\n\\nSo, 88,573 * 3 = 265,719.\\n\\nWait, let me verify:\\n\\nCompute 88,573 * 3:\\n\\nStarting from the right:\\n\\n3 * 3 = 9\\n\\n3 * 7 = 21, write 1, carryover 2.\\n\\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1.\\n\\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carryover 2.\\n\\n3 * 0 = 0 + 2 = 2.\\n\\nSo, the result is 265,719.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 265,719.\\n\\nWait, but earlier, I thought the innermost computation resulted in 88573, which when multiplied by 3 gives 265,719.\\n\\nBut let me double-check the innermost layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nLayer10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\n\\nYes, that seems correct.\\n\\nThen, the outermost is 3*88573 = 265,719.\\n\\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...), and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, total layers including the outermost is 10. But in my calculation, I did 10 layers, starting from the innermost.\\n\\nWait, actually, the outermost is 3*(...), so the ... is 9 layers, making it 10 layers in total.\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So, starting from the innermost, 1+3, which is layer1, up to layer10, which is 88573, then multiplied by 3 gives 265,719.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is 265,719.\\n\\nBut just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula.\\n\\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated application of the function f(x) = 1 + 3x. Starting from x=3, because the innermost is 1+3, which is 4, but actually, x starts at 3, but let me see.\\n\\nWait, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, which is f(3) = 4.\\n\\nThen, the next layer is f(4) = 13, then f(13)=40, f(40)=121, f(121)=364, f(364)=1093, f(1093)=3280, f(3280)=9841, f(9841)=29524, f(29524)=88573.\\n\\nSo, it's the 10th term in this sequence, starting from f(3)=4 as the first term.\\n\\nSo, f(3)=4, f(4)=13, f(13)=40, f(40)=121, f(121)=364, f(364)=1093, f(1093)=3280, f(3280)=9841, f(9841)=29524, f(29524)=88573.\\n\\nSo, the 10th term is 88573.\\n\\nThen, the outermost is 3*(88573) = 265,719.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this recurrence relation.\\n\\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\\n\\nWait, no, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, etc.\\n\\nSo, the general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = A*c^n + B, where A and B are constants.\\n\\nIn this case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\\n\\nSo, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution: a_n = B.\\n\\nPlugging into the equation: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\\n\\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\\n\\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\\n\\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\\n\\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\\n\\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\\n\\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\\n\\nSimilarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches.\\n\\nSo, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\\n\\nTherefore, for n=10, a_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2.\\n\\nCompute 3^{11}:\\n\\n3^1=3\\n\\n3^2=9\\n\\n3^3=27\\n\\n3^4=81\\n\\n3^5=243\\n\\n3^6=729\\n\\n3^7=2187\\n\\n3^8=6561\\n\\n3^9=19683\\n\\n3^10=59049\\n\\n3^11=177147\\n\\nSo, a_10 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573.\\n\\nThen, the outermost is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265,719.\\n\\nSo, this confirms my earlier calculation.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is 265,719.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe given expression is a nested computation involving repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1.

Let me check:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer9)\\n\\nBut wait, the original expression is:\\n\\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, and each time, another layer. Let me count the number of '1+3('.\\n\\nFrom the innermost:\\n\\n1. 1+3\\n2. 1+3(...)\\n3. 1+3(...)\\n4. 1+3(...)\\n5. 1+3(...)\\n6. 1+3(...)\\n7. 1+3(...)\\n8. 1+3(...)\\n9. 1+3(...)\\n\\nSo, that's 9 layers, and then the outermost is 3(...). So, total layers including the outermost is 10. But each time, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3(...), so 9 layers before the outermost 3(...).\\n\\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.\\n\\nEach time, we have a structure like 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous.\\n\\nSo, starting with the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13.\\n\\nThen, the next is 1 + 3*13 = 40.\\n\\nWait, earlier I got 40, but let me check:\\n\\nWait, earlier I thought I did 1 + 3*13, which is 40. Then, next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364, then 1 + 3*364 = 1093, then 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, then 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, then 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, then 1 + 3*29524 = 88573.\\n\\nWait, but how many times did I compute? Let's count:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\\n\\nSo, that's 10 layers, starting from the innermost. So, each step, we're doing 1 + 3*previous. So, that's 10 times.\\n\\nBut in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let's see:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer.\\n\\nThe expression is:\\n\\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\\n\\n1. 1+3\\n2. 1+3(...)\\n3. 1+3(...)\\n4. 1+3(...)\\n5. 1+3(...)\\n6. 1+3(...)\\n7. 1+3(...)\\n8. 1+3(...)\\n9. 1+3(...)\\n\\nSo, that's 9 layers, and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, total layers including the outermost is 10.\\n\\nBut in my previous calculation, I did 10 layers, starting from 1+3 up to 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. So, that would correspond to 10 layers.\\n\\nBut wait, the original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...), and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, actually, the total computation is 10 steps, but the expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 9 layers of 1+3(...).\\n\\nWait, no, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the ... is 8 layers, making it 9 layers in total. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\\n\\nLet me try to parse the expression again.\\n\\nThe original expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\\n10. 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\\n\\nSo, that's 10 layers, starting from the innermost. Then, the outermost is 3*(...), which would be 3*88573.\\n\\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so after computing all the inner layers, which is 9 layers, the result is 88573, and then multiplied by 3.\\n\\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I did 10 layers, starting from 1+3. So, perhaps I overcounted.\\n\\nWait, let me clarify:\\n\\nThe expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let's see:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\\n\\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\\n\\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer10) = 3*88573 = ?\\n\\nSo, 3*88573. Let me compute that.\\n\\nFirst, compute 88573 * 3.\\n\\nCompute 88573 * 3:\\n\\n70,000 * 3 = 210,000\\n\\nBut let me do it step by step.\\n\\n88,573 * 3:\\n\\n3 * 8 = 24, write down 4, carryover 2.\\n\\n3 * 7 = 21 + 2 = 23, write down 3, carryover 2.\\n\\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\\n\\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2.\\n\\n3 * 0 = 0 + 2 = 2.\\n\\nSo, 88,573 * 3 = 265,719.\\n\\nWait, let me verify:\\n\\nCompute 88,573 * 3:\\n\\nStarting from the right:\\n\\n3 * 3 = 9\\n\\n3 * 7 = 21, write 1, carryover 2.\\n\\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1.\\n\\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carryover 2.\\n\\n3 * 0 = 0 + 2 = 2.\\n\\nSo, the result is 265,719.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 265,719.\\n\\nWait, but earlier, I thought the innermost computation resulted in 88573, which when multiplied by 3 gives 265,719.\\n\\nBut let me double-check the innermost layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nLayer10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\n\\nYes, that seems correct.\\n\\nThen, the outermost is 3*88573 = 265,719.\\n\\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...), and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, total layers including the outermost is 10. But in my calculation, I did 10 layers, starting from the innermost.\\n\\nWait, actually, the outermost is 3*(...), so the ... is 9 layers, making it 10 layers in total.\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So, starting from the innermost, 1+3, which is layer1, up to layer10, which is 88573, then multiplied by 3 gives 265,719.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is 265,719.\\n\\nBut just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula.\\n\\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated application of the function f(x) = 1 + 3x. Starting from x=3, because the innermost is 1+3, which is 4, but actually, x starts at 3, but let me see.\\n\\nWait, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, which is f(3) = 4.\\n\\nThen, the next layer is f(4) = 13, then f(13)=40, f(40)=121, f(121)=364, f(364)=1093, f(1093)=3280, f(3280)=9841, f(9841)=29524, f(29524)=88573.\\n\\nSo, it's the 10th term in this sequence, starting from f(3)=4 as the first term.\\n\\nSo, f(3)=4, f(4)=13, f(13)=40, f(40)=121, f(121)=364, f(364)=1093, f(1093)=3280, f(3280)=9841, f(9841)=29524, f(29524)=88573.\\n\\nSo, the 10th term is 88573.\\n\\nThen, the outermost is 3*(88573) = 265,719.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this recurrence relation.\\n\\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\\n\\nWait, no, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, etc.\\n\\nSo, the general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = A*c^n + B, where A and B are constants.\\n\\nIn this case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\\n\\nSo, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution: a_n = B.\\n\\nPlugging into the equation: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\\n\\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\\n\\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\\n\\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\\n\\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\\n\\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\\n\\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\\n\\nSimilarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches.\\n\\nSo, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\\n\\nTherefore, for n=10, a_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2.\\n\\nCompute 3^{11}:\\n\\n3^1=3\\n\\n3^2=9\\n\\n3^3=27\\n\\n3^4=81\\n\\n3^5=243\\n\\n3^6=729\\n\\n3^7=2187\\n\\n3^8=6561\\n\\n3^9=19683\\n\\n3^10=59049\\n\\n3^11=177147\\n\\nSo, a_10 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573.\\n\\nThen, the outermost is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265,719.\\n\\nSo, this confirms my earlier calculation.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is 265,719.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe given expression is a nested computation involving repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. By breaking it down layer by layer, each step involves computing \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times \\\\text{previous result}\\\\). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost multiplication by 3. \\n\\nHere are the key steps:\\n\\n1.

After computing all inner layers, multiply the final result by 3.\\n\\nFollowing these steps, we find that the innermost computation results in 88,573.

Let me see:\\n\\nWait, no, actually, the original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression, right? So after computing the innermost 9 layers, I have to multiply the result by 3 as well.\\n\\nWait, let me clarify the structure:\\n\\nThe expression is \\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\).\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).

Next: 1 + 3*(result)\\n\\n...\\n\\n9. 1 + 3*(result)\\n\\nSo, yes, 9 layers. So, when I computed step 1 to step 9, I ended up with 29524.\\n\\nBut wait, in step 9, I was computing 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that's the innermost expression.\\n\\nBut then, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by that result.\\n\\nSo, the original problem is 3*(result of 9 layers). So, 3*29524.\\n\\nWait, is that correct?\\n\\nWait, no. Let me parse the expression correctly.\\n\\nThe expression is:\\n\\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) )\\n\\nSo, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... 9 times ... )).\\n\\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\\n\\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 4, we have:\\n\\nLayer 1: 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\\n\\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524.\\n\\nBut the entire original expression is 3*(that result).

So, the innermost expression is 1 +3=4.\\n\\nThen, each subsequent layer is 1 +3*(previous result). So, 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me count the layers again. Starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. (1 +3)=4\\n\\n2. 1 +3*4=13\\n\\n3. 1 +3*13=40\\n\\n4. 1 +3*40=121\\n\\n5. 1 +3*121=364\\n\\n6. 1 +3*364=1093\\n\\n7. 1 +3*1093=3280\\n\\n8. 1 +3*3280=9841\\n\\n9. 1 +3*9841=29524\\n\\nSo, 9 layers in total, correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each step again:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. 1 +3 =4\\n\\n2. 1 +3*4=1+12=13\\n\\n3. 1 +3*13=1+39=40\\n\\n4. 1 +3*40=1+120=121\\n\\n5. 1 +3*121=1+363=364\\n\\n6. 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\\n\\n7. 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\\n\\n8. 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\\n\\n9. 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88,572.\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without going through each step, but since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), step-by-step computation is feasible.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I notice that each step is of the form \\\\(x_{n} = 1 + 3x_{n-1}\\\\), starting from \\\\(x_1 = 4\\\\).\\n\\nSo, recursively, \\\\(x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}\\\\).\\n\\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation.\\n\\nThe solution to such a linear recurrence is \\\\(x_n = A \\\\cdot 3^n + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions.\\n\\nWait, let's solve the recurrence relation.\\n\\nGiven \\\\(x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}\\\\), with \\\\(x_1 = 4\\\\).\\n\\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\\n\\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: \\\\(x_n - 3x_{n-1} = 0\\\\). The characteristic equation is \\\\(r -3=0\\\\), so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is \\\\(A \\\\cdot 3^n\\\\).\\n\\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a constant particular solution \\\\(x_p = C\\\\).\\n\\nSubstitute into the recurrence: \\\\(C = 1 + 3C\\\\).\\n\\nSolving for C: \\\\(C - 3C =1 \\\\implies -2C=1 \\\\implies C= -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nThus, the general solution is \\\\(x_n = A \\\\cdot 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nApply initial condition \\\\(x_1=4\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(4 = A \\\\cdot 3^1 - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\implies 4 = 3A - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nSolve for A:\\n\\n\\\\(3A = 4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nThus, \\\\(A = \\\\frac{9}{2} / 3 = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the solution is \\\\(x_n = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\cdot 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nSimplify: \\\\(x_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1} -1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nSo, for n=9, \\\\(x_9 = \\\\frac{3^{10} -1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3^{10}\\\\):\\n\\n3^1=3\\n\\n3^2=9\\n\\n3^3=27\\n\\n3^4=81\\n\\n3^5=243\\n\\n3^6=729\\n\\n3^7=2187\\n\\n3^8=6561\\n\\n3^9=19683\\n\\n3^10=59049\\n\\nSo, \\\\(x_9 = \\\\frac{59049 -1}{2} = \\\\frac{59048}{2} = 29524\\\\).\\n\\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\\n\\nTherefore, the value inside the outermost 3* is 29524, so the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\\n\\nThus, the final answer is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524:\\n\\n29524 *3:\\n\\nCompute 29524 *3:\\n\\n24*3=72\\n\\n2*3=6, plus 7 carried over is 13\\n\\n9*3=27, plus 3 carried over is 30\\n\\n5*3=15, plus 3 carried over is 18\\n\\n2*3=6, no carryover.\\n\\nWait, no, that's not the standard way.

Let me count:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n\\n2. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{result})\\\\)\\n\\n3. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{result})\\\\)\\n\\n4. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{result})\\\\)\\n\\n5. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{result})\\\\)\\n\\n6. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{result})\\\\)\\n\\n7. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{result})\\\\)\\n\\n8. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{result})\\\\)\\n\\n9. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{result})\\\\)\\n\\nSo, after computing 9 layers, I should have the value. Let me recount my steps:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nWait, but when I did step 10, I was at 88573, but that's the 9th step? Let me see:\\n\\nWait, no, actually, the original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression, right? So after computing the innermost 9 layers, I have to multiply the result by 3 as well.\\n\\nWait, let me clarify the structure:\\n\\nThe expression is \\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\).\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, total layers from the innermost are 9, right?\\n\\nWait, let's count:\\n\\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\\n\\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(result)\\n\\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(result)\\n\\n...\\n\\n9. 1 + 3*(result)\\n\\nSo, yes, 9 layers. So, when I computed step 1 to step 9, I ended up with 29524.\\n\\nBut wait, in step 9, I was computing 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that's the innermost expression.\\n\\nBut then, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by that result.\\n\\nSo, the original problem is 3*(result of 9 layers). So, 3*29524.\\n\\nWait, is that correct?\\n\\nWait, no. Let me parse the expression correctly.\\n\\nThe expression is:\\n\\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) )\\n\\nSo, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... 9 times ... )).\\n\\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\\n\\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 4, we have:\\n\\nLayer 1: 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\\n\\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524.\\n\\nBut the entire original expression is 3*(that result). So, 3*29524.\\n\\nCompute 3*29524:\\n\\n29524 * 3:\\n\\n24*3=72, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6\\n\\nSo, 29524 * 3:\\n\\nStarting from the right:\\n\\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\\n\\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\\n\\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\\n\\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\\n\\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\\n\\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number.\\n\\nLet me do it digit by digit:\\n\\n29524\\n\\n*        3\\n\\nStart from the right:\\n\\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\\n\\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, no carryover.\\n\\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\\n\\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1.\\n\\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\\n\\nSo, the result is 88572.\\n\\nWait, so 3*29524=88572.\\n\\nBut let me double-check:\\n\\n29524 * 3:\\n\\n20,000 *3=60,000\\n\\n9,000*3=27,000\\n\\n500*3=1,500\\n\\n24*3=72\\n\\nAdd them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572.\\n\\nYes, 88,572.\\n\\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nBut let me just make sure I didn't miss a step. So, the innermost expression is 1 +3=4.\\n\\nThen, each subsequent layer is 1 +3*(previous result). So, 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me count the layers again. Starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. (1 +3)=4\\n\\n2. 1 +3*4=13\\n\\n3. 1 +3*13=40\\n\\n4. 1 +3*40=121\\n\\n5. 1 +3*121=364\\n\\n6. 1 +3*364=1093\\n\\n7. 1 +3*1093=3280\\n\\n8. 1 +3*3280=9841\\n\\n9. 1 +3*9841=29524\\n\\nSo, 9 layers in total, correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each step again:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. 1 +3 =4\\n\\n2. 1 +3*4=1+12=13\\n\\n3. 1 +3*13=1+39=40\\n\\n4. 1 +3*40=1+120=121\\n\\n5. 1 +3*121=1+363=364\\n\\n6. 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\\n\\n7. 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\\n\\n8. 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\\n\\n9. 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88,572.\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without going through each step, but since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), step-by-step computation is feasible.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I notice that each step is of the form \\\\(x_{n} = 1 + 3x_{n-1}\\\\), starting from \\\\(x_1 = 4\\\\).\\n\\nSo, recursively, \\\\(x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}\\\\).\\n\\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation.\\n\\nThe solution to such a linear recurrence is \\\\(x_n = A \\\\cdot 3^n + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions.\\n\\nWait, let's solve the recurrence relation.\\n\\nGiven \\\\(x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}\\\\), with \\\\(x_1 = 4\\\\).\\n\\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\\n\\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: \\\\(x_n - 3x_{n-1} = 0\\\\). The characteristic equation is \\\\(r -3=0\\\\), so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is \\\\(A \\\\cdot 3^n\\\\).\\n\\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a constant particular solution \\\\(x_p = C\\\\).\\n\\nSubstitute into the recurrence: \\\\(C = 1 + 3C\\\\).\\n\\nSolving for C: \\\\(C - 3C =1 \\\\implies -2C=1 \\\\implies C= -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nThus, the general solution is \\\\(x_n = A \\\\cdot 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nApply initial condition \\\\(x_1=4\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(4 = A \\\\cdot 3^1 - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\implies 4 = 3A - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nSolve for A:\\n\\n\\\\(3A = 4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nThus, \\\\(A = \\\\frac{9}{2} / 3 = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the solution is \\\\(x_n = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\cdot 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nSimplify: \\\\(x_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1} -1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nSo, for n=9, \\\\(x_9 = \\\\frac{3^{10} -1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3^{10}\\\\):\\n\\n3^1=3\\n\\n3^2=9\\n\\n3^3=27\\n\\n3^4=81\\n\\n3^5=243\\n\\n3^6=729\\n\\n3^7=2187\\n\\n3^8=6561\\n\\n3^9=19683\\n\\n3^10=59049\\n\\nSo, \\\\(x_9 = \\\\frac{59049 -1}{2} = \\\\frac{59048}{2} = 29524\\\\).\\n\\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\\n\\nTherefore, the value inside the outermost 3* is 29524, so the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\\n\\nThus, the final answer is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524:\\n\\n29524 *3:\\n\\nCompute 29524 *3:\\n\\n24*3=72\\n\\n2*3=6, plus 7 carried over is 13\\n\\n9*3=27, plus 3 carried over is 30\\n\\n5*3=15, plus 3 carried over is 18\\n\\n2*3=6, no carryover.\\n\\nWait, no, that's not the standard way. Let me do it properly:\\n\\n29524\\n\\n*       3\\n\\n------------\\n\\nStarting from the right:\\n\\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\\n\\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\\n\\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\\n\\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1.\\n\\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\\n\\nSo, the result is 88572.\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of the expression is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the expression \\\\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\\n\\n1.

It seems like a nested expression where each layer has a 1 plus 3 times something. I need to figure out the value step by step. Let me start by breaking it down from the inside out because it looks like a nested structure. \\n\\nFirst, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n2. Then, \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{result from step 1})\\\\)\\n3. Then, \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{result from step 2})\\\\)\\n4. Continuing this way until there are no more parentheses.\\n\\nWait, let me actually count the number of parentheses to ensure I don't miss any layer. Each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let's see:\\n\\n- Starting from the innermost: \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n- Then, moving out: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n- And so on... How many times does this happen?\\n\\nLooking at the expression, I can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n2. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n3. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n4. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n5. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n6. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n7. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n8. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n9. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n\\nSo, there are 9 layers in total. That means I'll need to compute the innermost expression first and work my way outwards, layer by layer.\\n\\nLet me write this down step by step.\\n\\n**Step 1:** Compute the innermost expression: \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 2:** Move one layer out: \\\\(1 + 3(4)\\\\)\\n\\nFirst, compute the multiplication: \\\\(3 \\\\times 4 = 12\\\\)\\n\\nThen, add 1: \\\\(1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 3:** Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3(13)\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3 \\\\times 13 = 39\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 4:** Next: \\\\(1 + 3(40)\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3 \\\\times 40 = 120\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 5:** Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3(121)\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3 \\\\times 121 = 363\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 363 = 364\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 6:** Next: \\\\(1 + 3(364)\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3 \\\\times 364 = 1092\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 7:** Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3(1093)\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3 \\\\times 1093 = 3279\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 8:** Next: \\\\(1 + 3(3280)\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3 \\\\times 3280 = 9840\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 9:** Now, the outermost layer: \\\\(3(9841)\\\\)\\n\\nWait a second, hold on. The outermost expression is \\\\(3(1 + \\\\text{something})\\\\). But in my previous steps, I've been computing \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\) each time. Let me check the structure again.\\n\\nLooking back at the original expression:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nYes, so after the first 3, the innermost expression is \\\\(1 + 3\\\\), and each subsequent layer is \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\). So, actually, the outermost operation is multiplying the result by 3, not adding 1 and then multiplying.\\n\\nSo, after computing up to the 9th layer, which gives me 9841, I need to multiply that by 3.\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 2: \\\\(1 + 3(4) = 13\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 3: \\\\(1 + 3(13) = 40\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 4: \\\\(1 + 3(40) = 121\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 5: \\\\(1 + 3(121) = 364\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 6: \\\\(1 + 3(364) = 1093\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 7: \\\\(1 + 3(1093) = 3280\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 8: \\\\(1 + 3(3280) = 9841\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 9: \\\\(3(9841)\\\\)\\n\\nSo, yes, the outermost operation is multiplying the result of layer 8 by 3, not adding 1 and then multiplying.\\n\\nWait, but the expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(...)), so actually, the structure is:\\n\\n3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is different from what I thought.\\n\\nSo, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me parse the expression again.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3\\n\\nThen, moving out:\\n\\n1 + 3*(1 + 3)\\n\\nThen, next layer:\\n\\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\\n\\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer:\\n\\n3*(1 + 3*(...))\\n\\nSo, in that case, the number of layers is 9, but the first operation is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\\n\\nSo, in that case, let's re-examine:\\n\\nLayer 1: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 2: \\\\(1 + 3*4 = 13\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 3: \\\\(1 + 3*13 = 40\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 4: \\\\(1 + 3*40 = 121\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 5: \\\\(1 + 3*121 = 364\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 6: \\\\(1 + 3*364 = 1093\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 7: \\\\(1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 8: \\\\(1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 9: \\\\(3*(1 + 3*9841)\\\\)\\n\\nWait, hold on. So, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + ...). So, actually, after computing layer 8, which is 9841, we need to compute 1 + 3*9841, and then multiply by 3.\\n\\nSo, let's compute that.\\n\\n**Step 9:** Compute \\\\(1 + 3*9841\\\\)\\n\\nFirst, compute \\\\(3 * 9841\\\\). Let's do that.\\n\\n\\\\(3 * 9841\\\\)\\n\\nLet me compute 9841 * 3:\\n\\n9841\\n*   3\\n------\\n (9*3) = 27, write down 7, carry over 2\\n (8*3) = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2\\n (4*3) = 12 + 2 = 14, write down 4, carry over 1\\n (0*3) = 0 + 1 = 1, write down 1\\n (1*3) = 3, write down 3\\n\\nSo, 3 * 9841 = 29,523\\n\\nThen, add 1: 29,523 + 1 = 29,524\\n\\nThen, multiply by 3: 3 * 29,524\\n\\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\\n\\n29,524\\n*    3\\n--------\\n (9*3) = 27, write down 7, carry over 2\\n (2*3) = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\\n (5*3) = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\\n (4*3) = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\\n (2*3) = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7\\n\\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572\\n\\nTherefore, the total value is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, let me verify my computations step by step because this is a bit error-prone.\\n\\nStarting again:\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\n2. \\\\(1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n\\n3. \\\\(1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n\\n4. \\\\(1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n\\n5. \\\\(1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\)\\n\\n6. \\\\(1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\\\)\\n\\n7. \\\\(1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\\\)\\n\\n8. \\\\(1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\\\)\\n\\n9. Now, the outermost operation: \\\\(3*(1 + 3*9,841)\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3*9,841\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(9,841 * 3 = 29,523\\\\)\\n\\nThen, add 1: \\\\(29,523 + 1 = 29,524\\\\)\\n\\nThen, multiply by 3: \\\\(29,524 * 3\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(29,524 * 3\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(29,524 * 3\\\\)\\n\\nLet's compute this carefully:\\n\\n- 29,524 * 3:\\n\\nBreak it down:\\n\\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\\n\\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\\n\\n500 * 3 = 1,500\\n\\n24 * 3 = 72\\n\\nSo, 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\\n\\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\\n\\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\\n\\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572\\n\\nTherefore, the total value is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me check if I followed the correct order of operations.\\n\\nYes, the expression is:\\n\\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and the outermost is 3*(1 + ...).\\n\\nSo, 9 layers in total, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), except the outermost which is 3*(1 + ...).\\n\\nSo, yes, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nBut just to be thorough, let me recompute all steps once more.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\n1.

Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\\n\\nThe recurrence is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\\\)\\n\\nWith \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\)\\n\\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and finding a particular solution.\\n\\nThe homogeneous recurrence is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0\\\\)\\n\\nThe characteristic equation is \\\\(r - 3 = 0\\\\), so \\\\(r = 3\\\\). Therefore, the homogeneous solution is \\\\(a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\\\\)\\n\\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution \\\\(a_n^{(p)} = K\\\\).\\n\\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\\n\\n\\\\(K = 1 + 3K\\\\)\\n\\nSolving for K:\\n\\n\\\\(K - 3K = 1\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(-2K = 1\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(K = -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nNow, apply the initial condition \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(4 = C*3^1 - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(4 = 3C - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nBring \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\) to the left:\\n\\n\\\\(4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = 3C\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(4.5 = 3C\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(C = \\\\frac{4.5}{3} = 1.5 = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3}{2}*3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo, for \\\\(n = 8\\\\), we have:\\n\\n\\\\(a_8 = \\\\frac{3^{9}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{19,683}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{19,682}{2} = 9,841\\\\)\\n\\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\\n\\nThen, for \\\\(a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*a_8)\\\\):\\n\\nCompute \\\\(1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\\\)\\n\\nThen, \\\\(3*29,524 = 88,572\\\\)\\n\\nSo, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula for \\\\(a_n\\\\):\\n\\nBut wait, \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo, for \\\\(n = 8\\\\), \\\\(a_8 = \\\\frac{3^{9} - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{19,683 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{19,682}{2} = 9,841\\\\)\\n\\nThen, \\\\(a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*a_8) = 3*(1 + 3*9,841) = 3*(1 + 29,523) = 3*29,524 = 88,572\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire computation in terms of powers of 3.\\n\\nLooking back at the recurrence \\\\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\\\), with \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\), we can write:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\\\)\\n\\nThis is similar to the recurrence for a geometric series with a constant term.\\n\\nThe solution we found was \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo, for \\\\(n = 8\\\\), \\\\(a_8 = \\\\frac{3^9 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{19,683 - 1}{2} = 9,841\\\\)\\n\\nThen, \\\\(a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*a_8) = 3*(1 + 3*(9,841)) = 3*(1 + 29,523) = 3*29,524 = 88,572\\\\)\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write \\\\(a_9\\\\) directly using the closed-form.\\n\\nWait, \\\\(a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*a_8)\\\\)\\n\\nBut \\\\(a_8 = \\\\frac{3^9 - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n\\\\(a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*(\\\\frac{3^9 - 1}{2})) = 3*(1 + \\\\frac{3^{10} - 3}{2})\\\\)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n\\\\(3*(\\\\frac{2 + 3^{10} - 3}{2}) = 3*(\\\\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2}) = \\\\frac{3^{11} - 3}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3^{11}\\\\):\\n\\n3^1 = 3\\n\\n3^2 = 9\\n\\n3^3 = 27\\n\\n3^4 = 81\\n\\n3^5 = 243\\n\\n3^6 = 729\\n\\n3^7 = 2,187\\n\\n3^8 = 6,561\\n\\n3^9 = 19,683\\n\\n3^10 = 59,049\\n\\n3^11 = 177,147\\n\\nTherefore,\\n\\n\\\\(a_9 = \\\\frac{177,147 - 3}{2} = \\\\frac{177,144}{2} = 88,572\\\\)\\n\\nYes, that's another way to compute it.\\n\\nSo, using the closed-form, \\\\(a_9 = \\\\frac{3^{11} - 3}{2} = 88,572\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nTo ensure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the arithmetic again.\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3^{11}\\\\):\\n\\n3^1 = 3\\n\\n3^2 = 9\\n\\n3^3 = 27\\n\\n3^4 = 81\\n\\n3^5 = 243\\n\\n3^6 = 729\\n\\n3^7 = 2,187\\n\\n3^8 = 6,561\\n\\n3^9 = 19,683\\n\\n3^10 = 59,049\\n\\n3^11 = 177,147\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nSo, \\\\(a_9 = \\\\frac{177,147 - 3}{2} = \\\\frac{177,144}{2} = 88,572\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\\n\\nJust to recap, starting from the innermost, each layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3, and after 8 such layers, we get 9,841, then the outermost operation is multiplying that by 3 after adding 1, which gives 88,572.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it directly.\\n\\nI think this is solid.

It seems like a nested expression where each layer has a 1 plus 3 times something. I need to figure out the value step by step. Let me start by breaking it down from the inside out because it looks like a nested structure. \\n\\nFirst, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n2. Then, \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{result from step 1})\\\\)\\n3. Then, \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{result from step 2})\\\\)\\n4. Continuing this way until there are no more parentheses.\\n\\nWait, let me actually count the number of parentheses to ensure I don't miss any layer. Each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let's see:\\n\\n- Starting from the innermost: \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n- Then, moving out: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n- And so on... How many times does this happen?\\n\\nLooking at the expression, I can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n2. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n3. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n4. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n5. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n6. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n7. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n8. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n9. \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\)\\n\\nSo, there are 9 layers in total. That means I'll need to compute the innermost expression first and work my way outwards, layer by layer.\\n\\nLet me write this down step by step.\\n\\n**Step 1:** Compute the innermost expression: \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 2:** Move one layer out: \\\\(1 + 3(4)\\\\)\\n\\nFirst, compute the multiplication: \\\\(3 \\\\times 4 = 12\\\\)\\n\\nThen, add 1: \\\\(1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 3:** Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3(13)\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3 \\\\times 13 = 39\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 4:** Next: \\\\(1 + 3(40)\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3 \\\\times 40 = 120\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 5:** Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3(121)\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3 \\\\times 121 = 363\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 363 = 364\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 6:** Next: \\\\(1 + 3(364)\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3 \\\\times 364 = 1092\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 7:** Next layer: \\\\(1 + 3(1093)\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3 \\\\times 1093 = 3279\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 8:** Next: \\\\(1 + 3(3280)\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3 \\\\times 3280 = 9840\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\)\\n\\n**Step 9:** Now, the outermost layer: \\\\(3(9841)\\\\)\\n\\nWait a second, hold on. The outermost expression is \\\\(3(1 + \\\\text{something})\\\\). But in my previous steps, I've been computing \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\) each time. Let me check the structure again.\\n\\nLooking back at the original expression:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nYes, so after the first 3, the innermost expression is \\\\(1 + 3\\\\), and each subsequent layer is \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\cdot)\\\\). So, actually, the outermost operation is multiplying the result by 3, not adding 1 and then multiplying.\\n\\nSo, after computing up to the 9th layer, which gives me 9841, I need to multiply that by 3.\\n\\nWait, hold on.

Let me parse the expression again.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3\\n\\nThen, moving out:\\n\\n1 + 3*(1 + 3)\\n\\nThen, next layer:\\n\\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\\n\\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer:\\n\\n3*(1 + 3*(...))\\n\\nSo, in that case, the number of layers is 9, but the first operation is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\\n\\nSo, in that case, let's re-examine:\\n\\nLayer 1: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 2: \\\\(1 + 3*4 = 13\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 3: \\\\(1 + 3*13 = 40\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 4: \\\\(1 + 3*40 = 121\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 5: \\\\(1 + 3*121 = 364\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 6: \\\\(1 + 3*364 = 1093\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 7: \\\\(1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 8: \\\\(1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 9: \\\\(3*(1 + 3*9841)\\\\)\\n\\nWait, hold on. So, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + ...). So, actually, after computing layer 8, which is 9841, we need to compute 1 + 3*9841, and then multiply by 3.\\n\\nSo, let's compute that.\\n\\n**Step 9:** Compute \\\\(1 + 3*9841\\\\)\\n\\nFirst, compute \\\\(3 * 9841\\\\).

Now, the outermost operation: \\\\(3*(1 + 3*9,841)\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3*9,841\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(9,841 * 3 = 29,523\\\\)\\n\\nThen, add 1: \\\\(29,523 + 1 = 29,524\\\\)\\n\\nThen, multiply by 3: \\\\(29,524 * 3\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(29,524 * 3\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(29,524 * 3\\\\)\\n\\nLet's compute this carefully:\\n\\n- 29,524 * 3:\\n\\nBreak it down:\\n\\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\\n\\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\\n\\n500 * 3 = 1,500\\n\\n24 * 3 = 72\\n\\nSo, 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\\n\\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\\n\\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\\n\\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572\\n\\nTherefore, the total value is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me check if I followed the correct order of operations.\\n\\nYes, the expression is:\\n\\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and the outermost is 3*(1 + ...).\\n\\nSo, 9 layers in total, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), except the outermost which is 3*(1 + ...).\\n\\nSo, yes, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nBut just to be thorough, let me recompute all steps once more.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\n9. Now, outermost: 3*(1 + 3*9,841)\\n\\nCompute 3*9,841: 29,523\\n\\nAdd 1: 29,523 + 1 = 29,524\\n\\nMultiply by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\\n\\nLet me denote \\\\(a_n\\\\) as the value at the nth layer, starting from the innermost.\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n\\\\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*a_8) = 3*(1 + 3*9,841) = 3*(1 + 29,523) = 3*29,524 = 88,572\\\\)\\n\\nYes, that's the same result as before.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a general formula for this kind of expression.\\n\\nNotice that each layer is of the form \\\\(a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\\\\), starting from \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\).\\n\\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\\n\\nThe recurrence is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\\\)\\n\\nWith \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\)\\n\\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and finding a particular solution.\\n\\nThe homogeneous recurrence is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0\\\\)\\n\\nThe characteristic equation is \\\\(r - 3 = 0\\\\), so \\\\(r = 3\\\\). Therefore, the homogeneous solution is \\\\(a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\\\\)\\n\\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution \\\\(a_n^{(p)} = K\\\\).\\n\\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\\n\\n\\\\(K = 1 + 3K\\\\)\\n\\nSolving for K:\\n\\n\\\\(K - 3K = 1\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(-2K = 1\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(K = -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nNow, apply the initial condition \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(4 = C*3^1 - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(4 = 3C - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nBring \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\) to the left:\\n\\n\\\\(4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = 3C\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(4.5 = 3C\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(C = \\\\frac{4.5}{3} = 1.5 = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3}{2}*3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo, for \\\\(n = 8\\\\), we have:\\n\\n\\\\(a_8 = \\\\frac{3^{9}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{19,683}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{19,682}{2} = 9,841\\\\)\\n\\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\\n\\nThen, for \\\\(a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*a_8)\\\\):\\n\\nCompute \\\\(1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\\\)\\n\\nThen, \\\\(3*29,524 = 88,572\\\\)\\n\\nSo, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula for \\\\(a_n\\\\):\\n\\nBut wait, \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo, for \\\\(n = 8\\\\), \\\\(a_8 = \\\\frac{3^{9} - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{19,683 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{19,682}{2} = 9,841\\\\)\\n\\nThen, \\\\(a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*a_8) = 3*(1 + 3*9,841) = 3*(1 + 29,523) = 3*29,524 = 88,572\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire computation in terms of powers of 3.\\n\\nLooking back at the recurrence \\\\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\\\), with \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\), we can write:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\\\)\\n\\nThis is similar to the recurrence for a geometric series with a constant term.\\n\\nThe solution we found was \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo, for \\\\(n = 8\\\\), \\\\(a_8 = \\\\frac{3^9 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{19,683 - 1}{2} = 9,841\\\\)\\n\\nThen, \\\\(a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*a_8) = 3*(1 + 3*(9,841)) = 3*(1 + 29,523) = 3*29,524 = 88,572\\\\)\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write \\\\(a_9\\\\) directly using the closed-form.\\n\\nWait, \\\\(a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*a_8)\\\\)\\n\\nBut \\\\(a_8 = \\\\frac{3^9 - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n\\\\(a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*(\\\\frac{3^9 - 1}{2})) = 3*(1 + \\\\frac{3^{10} - 3}{2})\\\\)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n\\\\(3*(\\\\frac{2 + 3^{10} - 3}{2}) = 3*(\\\\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2}) = \\\\frac{3^{11} - 3}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3^{11}\\\\):\\n\\n3^1 = 3\\n\\n3^2 = 9\\n\\n3^3 = 27\\n\\n3^4 = 81\\n\\n3^5 = 243\\n\\n3^6 = 729\\n\\n3^7 = 2,187\\n\\n3^8 = 6,561\\n\\n3^9 = 19,683\\n\\n3^10 = 59,049\\n\\n3^11 = 177,147\\n\\nTherefore,\\n\\n\\\\(a_9 = \\\\frac{177,147 - 3}{2} = \\\\frac{177,144}{2} = 88,572\\\\)\\n\\nYes, that's another way to compute it.\\n\\nSo, using the closed-form, \\\\(a_9 = \\\\frac{3^{11} - 3}{2} = 88,572\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nTo ensure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the arithmetic again.\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3^{11}\\\\):\\n\\n3^1 = 3\\n\\n3^2 = 9\\n\\n3^3 = 27\\n\\n3^4 = 81\\n\\n3^5 = 243\\n\\n3^6 = 729\\n\\n3^7 = 2,187\\n\\n3^8 = 6,561\\n\\n3^9 = 19,683\\n\\n3^10 = 59,049\\n\\n3^11 = 177,147\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nSo, \\\\(a_9 = \\\\frac{177,147 - 3}{2} = \\\\frac{177,144}{2} = 88,572\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\\n\\nJust to recap, starting from the innermost, each layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3, and after 8 such layers, we get 9,841, then the outermost operation is multiplying that by 3 after adding 1, which gives 88,572.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it directly.\\n\\nI think this is solid.

It looks a bit complicated at first glance with all those parentheses, but maybe if I break it down, it'll make more sense. Let me write it out again to visualize it better:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It seems like each level is another set of 1 + 3 multiplied by the next set. Maybe there's a pattern here that I can exploit instead of computing each step one by one. Hmm, let me think.\\n\\nI notice that the entire expression is a product of 3 and a sum that's built recursively. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next set of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out might be a good approach. That way, I can simplify each layer step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by focusing on the innermost part. The innermost parentheses are at the very end:\\n\\n(1 + 3)\\n\\nSo, let's compute that first.\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nOkay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next set of parentheses is:\\n\\n1 + 3(4)\\n\\nWait, let me check that. The expression is:\\n\\n1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\\n\\nSo, yes, replacing the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, we get:\\n\\n1 + 3(4)\\n\\nCompute that:\\n\\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nAlright, moving one level out again, the next set is:\\n\\n1 + 3(13)\\n\\nCompute that:\\n\\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nOkay, next layer out:\\n\\n1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nHmm, interesting. It seems like each time I'm replacing the innermost parentheses and multiplying by 3, then adding 1. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\\n\\nLet me list out the computations so far:\\n\\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nWait, so each step seems to be multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me see:\\n\\nFrom 4 to 13: 4*3 + 1 = 13\\n\\nFrom 13 to 40: 13*3 + 1 = 40\\n\\nFrom 40 to 121: 40*3 + 1 = 121\\n\\nSo, if this pattern continues, each step is taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. That seems like a recursive relationship.\\n\\nIf I continue this pattern, how many times will I have to do this? Let's count the number of parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. First: 1 + 3 = 4 (1 layer)\\n2. Second: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (2 layers)\\n3. Third: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (3 layers)\\n4. Fourth: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (4 layers)\\n5. Fifth: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (5 layers)\\n6. Sixth: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (6 layers)\\n7. Seventh: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (7 layers)\\n8. Eighth: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (8 layers)\\n9. Ninth: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (9 layers)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me check how many layers there are in the original expression.\\n\\nLooking back at the original expression:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let's see:\\n\\nStarting from the outermost:\\n\\n3( ... )\\n\\nInside that, there's another 3(...), and so on. Counting each 3 and the subsequent ( ... ), I can see that there are 9 layers of 3(...) before the innermost (1 + 3). So, that would mean we have 9 iterations of this pattern.\\n\\nWait, earlier when I was computing, I did 9 steps, ending up at 29524. Let me check that again.\\n\\nStarting from layer 1:\\n\\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, after 9 layers, the innermost expression simplifies to 29524. But wait, that's just the innermost part. Remember, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the very beginning.\\n\\nSo, the entire expression is:\\n\\n3 * (innermost expression)\\n\\nWhich we just found out is 3 * 29524.\\n\\nSo, let's compute that:\\n\\n3 * 29524 = ?\\n\\nLet me do that multiplication step by step.\\n\\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\\n\\nMultiply 29524 by 3:\\n\\n3 * 20000 = 60000\\n\\n3 * 9000 = 27000\\n\\n3 * 500 = 1500\\n\\n3 * 24 = 72\\n\\nWait, hold on. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n3 * 20000 = 60000\\n\\n3 * 9000 = 27000\\n\\n3 * 500 = 1500\\n\\n3 * 24 = 72\\n\\nNow, add them all up:\\n\\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\\n\\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\\n\\n88500 + 72 = 88572\\n\\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88,572\\n\\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me double-check my multiplication because that seems a bit high. Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 directly.\\n\\n29524\\n*      3\\n--------\\n29524 * 3:\\n\\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\\n\\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\\n\\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\\n\\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\\n\\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nSo, putting it together: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\\n\\nSo, after breaking down each layer step by step and recognizing the pattern, I was able to compute the entire expression by repeatedly applying the operation (result * 3 + 1) nine times, starting from the innermost parentheses. Then, multiplying the final result by 3 gives me the final answer.\\n\\nI think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:\\n\\n1. Start with the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\\n\\n2. Replace and compute next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\\n\\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\\n\\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\\n\\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\\n\\n6.

I think I did it right.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of the expression is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

Problem: Compute\\n\\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ Solution: \\n<think>\\nAlright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to compute this expression step by step. It looks a bit complicated at first glance with all those parentheses, but maybe if I break it down, it'll make more sense. Let me write it out again to visualize it better:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It seems like each level is another set of 1 + 3 multiplied by the next set. Maybe there's a pattern here that I can exploit instead of computing each step one by one. Hmm, let me think.\\n\\nI notice that the entire expression is a product of 3 and a sum that's built recursively. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next set of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out might be a good approach. That way, I can simplify each layer step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by focusing on the innermost part. The innermost parentheses are at the very end:\\n\\n(1 + 3)\\n\\nSo, let's compute that first.\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nOkay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next set of parentheses is:\\n\\n1 + 3(4)\\n\\nWait, let me check that. The expression is:\\n\\n1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\\n\\nSo, yes, replacing the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, we get:\\n\\n1 + 3(4)\\n\\nCompute that:\\n\\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nAlright, moving one level out again, the next set is:\\n\\n1 + 3(13)\\n\\nCompute that:\\n\\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nOkay, next layer out:\\n\\n1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nHmm, interesting. It seems like each time I'm replacing the innermost parentheses and multiplying by 3, then adding 1. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\\n\\nLet me list out the computations so far:\\n\\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nWait, so each step seems to be multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me see:\\n\\nFrom 4 to 13: 4*3 + 1 = 13\\n\\nFrom 13 to 40: 13*3 + 1 = 40\\n\\nFrom 40 to 121: 40*3 + 1 = 121\\n\\nSo, if this pattern continues, each step is taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. That seems like a recursive relationship.\\n\\nIf I continue this pattern, how many times will I have to do this? Let's count the number of parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. First: 1 + 3 = 4 (1 layer)\\n2. Second: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (2 layers)\\n3. Third: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (3 layers)\\n4. Fourth: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (4 layers)\\n5. Fifth: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (5 layers)\\n6. Sixth: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (6 layers)\\n7. Seventh: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (7 layers)\\n8. Eighth: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (8 layers)\\n9. Ninth: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (9 layers)\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me check how many layers there are in the original expression.\\n\\nLooking back at the original expression:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let's see:\\n\\nStarting from the outermost:\\n\\n3( ... )\\n\\nInside that, there's another 3(...), and so on. Counting each 3 and the subsequent ( ... ), I can see that there are 9 layers of 3(...) before the innermost (1 + 3). So, that would mean we have 9 iterations of this pattern.\\n\\nWait, earlier when I was computing, I did 9 steps, ending up at 29524. Let me check that again.\\n\\nStarting from layer 1:\\n\\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, after 9 layers, the innermost expression simplifies to 29524. But wait, that's just the innermost part. Remember, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the very beginning.\\n\\nSo, the entire expression is:\\n\\n3 * (innermost expression)\\n\\nWhich we just found out is 3 * 29524.\\n\\nSo, let's compute that:\\n\\n3 * 29524 = ?\\n\\nLet me do that multiplication step by step.\\n\\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\\n\\nMultiply 29524 by 3:\\n\\n3 * 20000 = 60000\\n\\n3 * 9000 = 27000\\n\\n3 * 500 = 1500\\n\\n3 * 24 = 72\\n\\nWait, hold on. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n3 * 20000 = 60000\\n\\n3 * 9000 = 27000\\n\\n3 * 500 = 1500\\n\\n3 * 24 = 72\\n\\nNow, add them all up:\\n\\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\\n\\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\\n\\n88500 + 72 = 88572\\n\\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88,572\\n\\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me double-check my multiplication because that seems a bit high. Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 directly.\\n\\n29524\\n*      3\\n--------\\n29524 * 3:\\n\\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\\n\\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\\n\\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\\n\\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\\n\\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nSo, putting it together: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\\n\\nSo, after breaking down each layer step by step and recognizing the pattern, I was able to compute the entire expression by repeatedly applying the operation (result * 3 + 1) nine times, starting from the innermost parentheses. Then, multiplying the final result by 3 gives me the final answer.\\n\\nI think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:\\n\\n1. Start with the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\\n\\n2. Replace and compute next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\\n\\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\\n\\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\\n\\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\\n\\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\\n\\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\\n\\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\\n\\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524.\\n\\n10. Multiply by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\\n\\nYep, that all adds up. I think I did it right.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of the expression is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The expression is:\\n\\n\\\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\]\\n\\nWe recognize that each layer can be simplified by repeatedly applying the operation \\\\( \\\\text{result} \\\\times 3 + 1 \\\\).

Let me see how I can tackle this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built using a repeating pattern: 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). The something inside each set of parentheses seems to be another similar expression. So, it's like a recursive structure. Maybe I can break it down from the innermost part.\\n\\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nOkay, so starting from the innermost part, the last set of parentheses is \\\\(1 + 3\\\\). Let me compute that first.\\n\\n1. Compute the innermost expression: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\).\\n2. Now, move one level up: \\\\(1 + 3(4)\\\\). That would be \\\\(1 + 12 = 13\\\\).\\n3. Next level up: \\\\(1 + 3(13)\\\\). That's \\\\(1 + 39 = 40\\\\).\\n4. Moving up again: \\\\(1 + 3(40)\\\\). So, \\\\(1 + 120 = 121\\\\).\\n5. Next: \\\\(1 + 3(121)\\\\). That's \\\\(1 + 363 = 364\\\\).\\n6. Then: \\\\(1 + 3(364)\\\\). That gives \\\\(1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\).\\n7. Next: \\\\(1 + 3(1093)\\\\). So, \\\\(1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\).\\n8. Then: \\\\(1 + 3(3280)\\\\). That's \\\\(1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\).\\n9. Moving up: \\\\(1 + 3(9841)\\\\). That gives \\\\(1 + 29523 = 29524\\\\).\\n10. Finally, the outermost expression: \\\\(3(29524)\\\\). So, \\\\(3 \\\\times 29524\\\\). Let me compute that.\\n\\nWait, let me make sure I did each step correctly. It's easy to make a mistake with so many multiplications. Let me go through each step again to verify.\\n\\nStarting from the inside:\\n\\n1. Innermost: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\). That seems right.\\n2. Next: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4\\\\). So, \\\\(1 + 12 = 13\\\\). Correct.\\n3. Then: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13\\\\). \\\\(1 + 39 = 40\\\\). Okay.\\n4. Next: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 40\\\\). \\\\(1 + 120 = 121\\\\). Good.\\n5. Then: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 121\\\\). \\\\(1 + 363 = 364\\\\). Yes.\\n6. Next: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 364\\\\). \\\\(1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\). Correct.\\n7. Then: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 1093\\\\). \\\\(1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\). Yes.\\n8. Moving up: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3280\\\\). \\\\(1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\). Correct.\\n9. Next: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 9841\\\\). \\\\(1 + 29523 = 29524\\\\). Yes.\\n10. Finally, \\\\(3 \\\\times 29524\\\\). Let me compute that.\\n\\n29524 multiplied by 3. Let's break it down:\\n\\n29524 x 3:\\n- 20000 x 3 = 60000\\n- 9000 x 3 = 27000\\n- 500 x 3 = 1500\\n- 24 x 3 = 72\\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\\n\\nSo, 3 x 29524 = 88572.\\n\\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that multiplication again.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 x 3 directly:\\n\\n29524\\nx    3\\n--------\\nStarting from the right:\\n4 x 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\\n2 x 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\\n5 x 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\\n9 x 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\\n2 x 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nSo, it's 88572. Hmm, okay, that seems consistent.\\n\\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake earlier. So, stepping back, each step seems to add 3 times the previous result, starting from 4. So, 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 88572.\\n\\nI can cross-verify this by noticing the pattern. Each step is 3n + 1, where n is the previous term. Let me see:\\n\\nStart with 4.\\n\\nNext: 3*4 + 1 = 13.\\n\\nThen: 3*13 + 1 = 40.\\n\\nNext: 3*40 + 1 = 121.\\n\\nThen: 3*121 + 1 = 364.\\n\\nNext: 3*364 + 1 = 1093.\\n\\nThen: 3*1093 + 1 = 3280.\\n\\nNext: 3*3280 + 1 = 9841.\\n\\nThen: 3*9841 + 1 = 29524.\\n\\nFinally: 3*29524 = 88572.\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be simplified using a series or a formula.\\n\\nLooking at the structure, it's a repeated application of the function f(n) = 3(n + 1). Starting from n = 1, and applying it 9 times (since there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3).\\n\\nWait, actually, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is f(1) = 4, then each subsequent layer is f applied again.\\n\\nSo, each time, we're applying f(n) = 3(n + 1). So, starting from n = 1, let's see:\\n\\nn\\u2080 = 1\\n\\nn\\u2081 = 3(n\\u2080 + 1) = 4\\n\\nn\\u2082 = 3(n\\u2081 + 1) = 13\\n\\nn\\u2083 = 3(n\\u2082 + 1) = 40\\n\\nn\\u2084 = 3(n\\u2083 + 1) = 121\\n\\nn\\u2085 = 3(n\\u2084 + 1) = 364\\n\\nn\\u2086 = 3(n\\u2085 + 1) = 1093\\n\\nn\\u2087 = 3(n\\u2086 + 1) = 3280\\n\\nn\\u2088 = 3(n\\u2087 + 1) = 9841\\n\\nn\\u2089 = 3(n\\u2088 + 1) = 29524\\n\\nn\\u2081\\u2080 = 3(n\\u2089) = 88572\\n\\nSo, that's 10 steps, starting from n\\u2080 to n\\u2081\\u2080.\\n\\nAlternatively, since each step is n_{k+1} = 3(n_k + 1), we can express n_k in terms of n\\u2080.\\n\\nLet me try to find a general formula for n_k.\\n\\nStarting from n\\u2080 = 1,\\n\\nn\\u2081 = 3(n\\u2080 + 1) = 3*1 + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6? Wait, no, that's not correct because n\\u2081 is 4 as above.\\n\\nWait, n\\u2081 = 3(n\\u2080 + 1) = 3*(1 + 1) = 6? But earlier I got n\\u2081 = 4. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\\n\\nWait no, let's clarify. The expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so starting with the innermost 1 + 3, which is 4, then each step is 3*(previous result + 1). So, n\\u2081 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12? Wait, no, that's not matching.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I confused the steps. Let me clarify.\\n\\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))). So, starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen, moving out: 3*(4) = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nNext: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nThen: 3*40 = 120, 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nThen: 3*121 = 363, 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nThen: 3*364 = 1092, 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nThen: 3*1093 = 3279, 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nThen: 3*3280 = 9840, 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nThen: 3*9841 = 29523, 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nFinally: 3*29524 = 88572\\n\\nWait, so each time, it's 3*(previous result) + 1.\\n\\nSo, n\\u2081 = 3*4 = 12, but then n\\u2081 is 1 + 3*4 = 13?

Problem: Compute\\n\\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ Solution: \\n<think>\\nAlright, so I have this math problem to solve: Compute \\\\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\\\). Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me see how I can tackle this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built using a repeating pattern: 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). The something inside each set of parentheses seems to be another similar expression. So, it's like a recursive structure. Maybe I can break it down from the innermost part.\\n\\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nOkay, so starting from the innermost part, the last set of parentheses is \\\\(1 + 3\\\\).

That's \\\\(1 + 363 = 364\\\\).\\n6. Then: \\\\(1 + 3(364)\\\\). That gives \\\\(1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\).\\n7. Next: \\\\(1 + 3(1093)\\\\). So, \\\\(1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\).\\n8. Then: \\\\(1 + 3(3280)\\\\). That's \\\\(1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\).\\n9. Moving up: \\\\(1 + 3(9841)\\\\). That gives \\\\(1 + 29523 = 29524\\\\).\\n10.

Next: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4\\\\). So, \\\\(1 + 12 = 13\\\\). Correct.\\n3. Then: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13\\\\). \\\\(1 + 39 = 40\\\\). Okay.\\n4.

Moving up: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3280\\\\). \\\\(1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\). Correct.\\n9. Next: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 9841\\\\). \\\\(1 + 29523 = 29524\\\\). Yes.\\n10. Finally, \\\\(3 \\\\times 29524\\\\). Let me compute that.\\n\\n29524 multiplied by 3. Let's break it down:\\n\\n29524 x 3:\\n- 20000 x 3 = 60000\\n- 9000 x 3 = 27000\\n- 500 x 3 = 1500\\n- 24 x 3 = 72\\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\\n\\nSo, 3 x 29524 = 88572.\\n\\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that multiplication again.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 x 3 directly:\\n\\n29524\\nx    3\\n--------\\nStarting from the right:\\n4 x 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\\n2 x 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\\n5 x 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\\n9 x 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\\n2 x 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nSo, it's 88572. Hmm, okay, that seems consistent.\\n\\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake earlier. So, stepping back, each step seems to add 3 times the previous result, starting from 4. So, 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 88572.\\n\\nI can cross-verify this by noticing the pattern. Each step is 3n + 1, where n is the previous term. Let me see:\\n\\nStart with 4.\\n\\nNext: 3*4 + 1 = 13.\\n\\nThen: 3*13 + 1 = 40.\\n\\nNext: 3*40 + 1 = 121.\\n\\nThen: 3*121 + 1 = 364.\\n\\nNext: 3*364 + 1 = 1093.\\n\\nThen: 3*1093 + 1 = 3280.\\n\\nNext: 3*3280 + 1 = 9841.\\n\\nThen: 3*9841 + 1 = 29524.\\n\\nFinally: 3*29524 = 88572.\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be simplified using a series or a formula.\\n\\nLooking at the structure, it's a repeated application of the function f(n) = 3(n + 1). Starting from n = 1, and applying it 9 times (since there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3).\\n\\nWait, actually, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is f(1) = 4, then each subsequent layer is f applied again.\\n\\nSo, each time, we're applying f(n) = 3(n + 1). So, starting from n = 1, let's see:\\n\\nn\\u2080 = 1\\n\\nn\\u2081 = 3(n\\u2080 + 1) = 4\\n\\nn\\u2082 = 3(n\\u2081 + 1) = 13\\n\\nn\\u2083 = 3(n\\u2082 + 1) = 40\\n\\nn\\u2084 = 3(n\\u2083 + 1) = 121\\n\\nn\\u2085 = 3(n\\u2084 + 1) = 364\\n\\nn\\u2086 = 3(n\\u2085 + 1) = 1093\\n\\nn\\u2087 = 3(n\\u2086 + 1) = 3280\\n\\nn\\u2088 = 3(n\\u2087 + 1) = 9841\\n\\nn\\u2089 = 3(n\\u2088 + 1) = 29524\\n\\nn\\u2081\\u2080 = 3(n\\u2089) = 88572\\n\\nSo, that's 10 steps, starting from n\\u2080 to n\\u2081\\u2080.\\n\\nAlternatively, since each step is n_{k+1} = 3(n_k + 1), we can express n_k in terms of n\\u2080.\\n\\nLet me try to find a general formula for n_k.\\n\\nStarting from n\\u2080 = 1,\\n\\nn\\u2081 = 3(n\\u2080 + 1) = 3*1 + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6? Wait, no, that's not correct because n\\u2081 is 4 as above.\\n\\nWait, n\\u2081 = 3(n\\u2080 + 1) = 3*(1 + 1) = 6? But earlier I got n\\u2081 = 4. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\\n\\nWait no, let's clarify. The expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so starting with the innermost 1 + 3, which is 4, then each step is 3*(previous result + 1). So, n\\u2081 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12? Wait, no, that's not matching.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I confused the steps. Let me clarify.\\n\\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))). So, starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen, moving out: 3*(4) = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nNext: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nThen: 3*40 = 120, 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nThen: 3*121 = 363, 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nThen: 3*364 = 1092, 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nThen: 3*1093 = 3279, 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nThen: 3*3280 = 9840, 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nThen: 3*9841 = 29523, 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nFinally: 3*29524 = 88572\\n\\nWait, so each time, it's 3*(previous result) + 1.\\n\\nSo, n\\u2081 = 3*4 = 12, but then n\\u2081 is 1 + 3*4 = 13? Wait, no, that's not matching. Let me see.\\n\\nActually, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, each time, it's 3*(something), and that something is 1 + 3*(...). So, each step is 3*(1 + previous step).\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost:\\n\\nLet me define a sequence where a\\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen, a\\u2082 = 3*(a\\u2081) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\\n\\na\\u2083 = 3*a\\u2082 + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\\n\\na\\u2084 = 3*a\\u2083 + 1 = 121\\n\\na\\u2085 = 3*a\\u2084 + 1 = 364\\n\\na\\u2086 = 3*a\\u2085 + 1 = 1093\\n\\na\\u2087 = 3*a\\u2086 + 1 = 3280\\n\\na\\u2088 = 3*a\\u2087 + 1 = 9841\\n\\na\\u2089 = 3*a\\u2088 + 1 = 29524\\n\\na\\u2081\\u2080 = 3*a\\u2089 = 88572\\n\\nSo, that's 9 steps after the innermost, leading to a\\u2081\\u2080 = 88572.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication steps.

So it's a nested expression where each layer is a 3 multiplied by something, and that something is 1 plus another 3 multiplied by another expression. It seems to go on for quite a few layers. I think the best approach is to work from the innermost parentheses outwards. That usually seems to be the way with nested expressions.\\n\\nSo, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part:\\n\\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3 times that result\\n3. Then, 1 + 3 times that result, and so on.\\n\\nLet me try to count the number of layers. Each time I see a \\\"1 + 3(...)\\\", that's a new layer. Let's see:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer9)\\n\\nWait, so that's 10 layers? Let me count again:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost parenthesis: 1 + 3. That's Layer1.\\n\\nThen, moving out, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So:\\n\\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nLayer10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\n\\nSo, according to this, the innermost part resolves to 88573, and then we have to multiply that by 3 at the very end. Wait, let me check the original expression again.\\n\\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, yes, the outermost operation is 3*(something).

Problem: Compute\\n\\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ Solution: \\n<think>\\nAlright, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. It looks a bit complicated at first glance, but I think I can break it down step by step. Let me write it out again to make sure I have it right:\\n\\nCompute\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nHmm, okay. So it's a nested expression where each layer is a 3 multiplied by something, and that something is 1 plus another 3 multiplied by another expression. It seems to go on for quite a few layers. I think the best approach is to work from the innermost parentheses outwards. That usually seems to be the way with nested expressions.\\n\\nSo, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part:\\n\\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3 times that result\\n3. Then, 1 + 3 times that result, and so on.\\n\\nLet me try to count the number of layers. Each time I see a \\\"1 + 3(...)\\\", that's a new layer. Let's see:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer9)\\n\\nWait, so that's 10 layers? Let me count again:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost parenthesis: 1 + 3. That's Layer1.\\n\\nThen, moving out, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So:\\n\\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nLayer10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\n\\nSo, according to this, the innermost part resolves to 88573, and then we have to multiply that by 3 at the very end. Wait, let me check the original expression again.\\n\\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, yes, the outermost operation is 3*(something). So, after computing the innermost 10 layers, which gives me 88573, I need to multiply that by 3. So, the final result should be 3*88573.\\n\\nLet me compute that:\\n\\n3 * 88573.\\n\\nHmm, 3 times 88,573. Let me break that down:\\n\\n3 * 80,000 = 240,000\\n\\n3 * 5,573 = ?\\n\\nWait, 5,573 * 3:\\n\\n3 * 5,000 = 15,000\\n\\n3 * 500 = 1,500\\n\\n3 * 70 = 210\\n\\n3 * 3 = 9\\n\\nSo, 15,000 + 1,500 = 16,500\\n\\n16,500 + 210 = 16,710\\n\\n16,710 + 9 = 16,719\\n\\nSo, 3 * 5,573 = 16,719\\n\\nTherefore, 3 * 88,573 = 240,000 + 16,719 = 256,719\\n\\nWait, is that right?

Starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds a layer.\\n\\nLooking at the expression:\\n\\n- Layer 1: \\\\( 1 + 3 \\\\)\\n- Layer 2: \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 1}) \\\\)\\n- Layer 3: \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 2}) \\\\)\\n- ...\\n- Up to Layer 9: \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 8}) \\\\)\\n\\nSo, there are 9 layers in total.\\n\\nTherefore, I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\\n\\nLet's create a table to keep track:\\n\\n| Layer | Expression              | Calculation | Result |\\n|------|------------------------|-------------|--------|\\n| 1    | \\\\( 1 + 3 \\\\)             | 1 + 3       | 4      |\\n| 2    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 1}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 4)   | 15     |\\n| 3    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 2}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 15)  | 48     |\\n| 4    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 3}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 48)  | 147    |\\n| 5    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 4}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 147) | 444    |\\n| 6    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 5}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 444) | 1335   |\\n| 7    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 6}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 1335)| 4012   |\\n| 8    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 7}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 4012)| 12039  |\\n| 9    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 8}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 12039)| 36122  |\\n\\nWait a second, let me verify each calculation because I feel like I might be making an error here.\\n\\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\\n\\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. That's correct.\\n\\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\\n\\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\\n\\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\\n\\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\\n\\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4012. Correct.\\n\\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4012) = 3*4013 = 12039. Correct.\\n\\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12039) = 3*12040 = 36120.\\n\\nWait, hold on, in my table above, Layer 9 result was 36122, but here I just calculated 3*12040 = 36120. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check my table again.\\n\\nLooking back, Layer 8 is 12039, which is correct because 3*(1 + 4012) = 3*4013 = 12039.\\n\\nThen, Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12039) = 3*12040 = 36120.\\n\\nBut in my table, I had Layer 9 as 36122, which is incorrect. So, that was a mistake. Let me correct that.\\n\\nSo, updating the table:\\n\\n| Layer | Expression              | Calculation | Result |\\n|------|------------------------|-------------|--------|\\n| 1    | \\\\( 1 + 3 \\\\)             | 1 + 3       | 4      |\\n| 2    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 1}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 4)   | 15     |\\n| 3    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 2}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 15)  | 48     |\\n| 4    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 3}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 48)  | 147    |\\n| 5    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 4}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 147) | 444    |\\n| 6    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 5}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 444) | 1335   |\\n| 7    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 6}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 1335)| 4012   |\\n| 8    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 7}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 4012)| 12039  |\\n| 9    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 8}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 12039)| 36120  |\\n\\nSo, the final result is 36120. But let me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\\n\\nStarting from Layer 1:\\n\\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\\n2. Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\\n3. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\\n4. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\\n5. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\\n6. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\\n7. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4012. Correct.\\n8. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4012) = 3*4013 = 12039. Correct.\\n9. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12039) = 3*12040 = 36120. Correct.\\n\\nSo, yes, the final result is 36120. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 36120.\\n\\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing it another way. Maybe by expanding the expression step by step without using a table.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\\n\\nFirst, compute \\\\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\\\).\\n\\nThen, moving outward: \\\\( 3(1 + 4) = 3 \\\\times 5 = 15 \\\\).\\n\\nNext layer: \\\\( 3(1 + 15) = 3 \\\\times 16 = 48 \\\\).\\n\\nContinuing: \\\\( 3(1 + 48) = 3 \\\\times 49 = 147 \\\\).\\n\\nNext: \\\\( 3(1 + 147) = 3 \\\\times 148 = 444 \\\\).\\n\\nThen: \\\\( 3(1 + 444) = 3 \\\\times 445 = 1335 \\\\).\\n\\nNext: \\\\( 3(1 + 1335) = 3 \\\\times 1336 = 4012 \\\\).\\n\\nContinuing: \\\\( 3(1 + 4012) = 3 \\\\times 4013 = 12039 \\\\).\\n\\nFinally: \\\\( 3(1 + 12039) = 3 \\\\times 12040 = 36120 \\\\).\\n\\nYes, that's the same result. So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 36120.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can think about this expression as a geometric series or something similar, but given the nested structure, it's probably better to compute step by step as I did.\\n\\nLet me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is 3 times (1 plus the previous result). So, each time, we're doing f(n) = 3(1 + f(n-1)), starting from f(1) = 4.\\n\\nSo, f(1) = 4\\n\\nf(2) = 3(1 + 4) = 15\\n\\nf(3) = 3(1 + 15) = 48\\n\\nf(4) = 3(1 + 48) = 147\\n\\nf(5) = 3(1 + 147) = 444\\n\\nf(6) = 3(1 + 444) = 1335\\n\\nf(7) = 3(1 + 1335) = 4012\\n\\nf(8) = 3(1 + 4012) = 12039\\n\\nf(9) = 3(1 + 12039) = 36120\\n\\nYes, this is consistent with what I did earlier. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 3 times (1 plus the previous term), starting from 4. So, after 9 terms, we get 36120.\\n\\nI don't think I made any calculation errors because each step builds on the previous one correctly, and I verified each step individually. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 36120.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of the expression is \\\\boxed{36120}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the expression \\\\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward step by step.\\n\\n1.

Let me track each step properly.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: \\\\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\\\).\\n\\nNow, moving outward, the next layer is \\\\( 3 \\\\times (1 + \\\\text{Layer 1}) = 3 \\\\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\\\times 5 = 15 \\\\).\\n\\nSo, replacing Layer 1, the expression becomes:\\n\\n\\\\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\)\\n\\nWait, that seems like it's not reducing the expression correctly. Maybe I need to work step by step, layer by layer, reducing one set of parentheses at a time.\\n\\nLet me try again, perhaps writing each step as I go.\\n\\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\\n\\n1. Compute the innermost: \\\\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\\\).\\n\\n2. Next layer out: \\\\( 1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\\\).\\n\\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because each layer is \\\\( 3 \\\\times (1 + \\\\text{next layer}) \\\\). So, after the innermost is 4, the next layer is \\\\( 3 \\\\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\\\times 5 = 15 \\\\).\\n\\nThen, moving outward, the next layer would be \\\\( 3 \\\\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\\\times 16 = 48 \\\\).\\n\\nWait, maybe I should number the layers to keep track.\\n\\nLet me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds a layer.\\n\\nLooking at the expression:\\n\\n- Layer 1: \\\\( 1 + 3 \\\\)\\n- Layer 2: \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 1}) \\\\)\\n- Layer 3: \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 2}) \\\\)\\n- ...\\n- Up to Layer 9: \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 8}) \\\\)\\n\\nSo, there are 9 layers in total.\\n\\nTherefore, I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\\n\\nLet's create a table to keep track:\\n\\n| Layer | Expression              | Calculation | Result |\\n|------|------------------------|-------------|--------|\\n| 1    | \\\\( 1 + 3 \\\\)             | 1 + 3       | 4      |\\n| 2    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 1}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 4)   | 15     |\\n| 3    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 2}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 15)  | 48     |\\n| 4    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 3}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 48)  | 147    |\\n| 5    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 4}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 147) | 444    |\\n| 6    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 5}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 444) | 1335   |\\n| 7    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 6}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 1335)| 4012   |\\n| 8    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 7}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 4012)| 12039  |\\n| 9    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 8}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 12039)| 36122  |\\n\\nWait a second, let me verify each calculation because I feel like I might be making an error here.\\n\\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\\n\\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. That's correct.\\n\\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\\n\\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\\n\\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\\n\\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\\n\\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4012. Correct.\\n\\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4012) = 3*4013 = 12039. Correct.\\n\\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12039) = 3*12040 = 36120.\\n\\nWait, hold on, in my table above, Layer 9 result was 36122, but here I just calculated 3*12040 = 36120. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check my table again.\\n\\nLooking back, Layer 8 is 12039, which is correct because 3*(1 + 4012) = 3*4013 = 12039.\\n\\nThen, Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12039) = 3*12040 = 36120.\\n\\nBut in my table, I had Layer 9 as 36122, which is incorrect. So, that was a mistake. Let me correct that.\\n\\nSo, updating the table:\\n\\n| Layer | Expression              | Calculation | Result |\\n|------|------------------------|-------------|--------|\\n| 1    | \\\\( 1 + 3 \\\\)             | 1 + 3       | 4      |\\n| 2    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 1}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 4)   | 15     |\\n| 3    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 2}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 15)  | 48     |\\n| 4    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 3}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 48)  | 147    |\\n| 5    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 4}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 147) | 444    |\\n| 6    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 5}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 444) | 1335   |\\n| 7    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 6}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 1335)| 4012   |\\n| 8    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 7}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 4012)| 12039  |\\n| 9    | \\\\( 3(1 + \\\\text{Layer 8}) \\\\) | 3(1 + 12039)| 36120  |\\n\\nSo, the final result is 36120. But let me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\\n\\nStarting from Layer 1:\\n\\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\\n2. Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\\n3. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\\n4. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\\n5. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\\n6. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\\n7. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4012. Correct.\\n8. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4012) = 3*4013 = 12039. Correct.\\n9. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12039) = 3*12040 = 36120. Correct.\\n\\nSo, yes, the final result is 36120. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 36120.\\n\\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing it another way. Maybe by expanding the expression step by step without using a table.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\\n\\nFirst, compute \\\\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\\\).\\n\\nThen, moving outward: \\\\( 3(1 + 4) = 3 \\\\times 5 = 15 \\\\).\\n\\nNext layer: \\\\( 3(1 + 15) = 3 \\\\times 16 = 48 \\\\).\\n\\nContinuing: \\\\( 3(1 + 48) = 3 \\\\times 49 = 147 \\\\).\\n\\nNext: \\\\( 3(1 + 147) = 3 \\\\times 148 = 444 \\\\).\\n\\nThen: \\\\( 3(1 + 444) = 3 \\\\times 445 = 1335 \\\\).\\n\\nNext: \\\\( 3(1 + 1335) = 3 \\\\times 1336 = 4012 \\\\).\\n\\nContinuing: \\\\( 3(1 + 4012) = 3 \\\\times 4013 = 12039 \\\\).\\n\\nFinally: \\\\( 3(1 + 12039) = 3 \\\\times 12040 = 36120 \\\\).\\n\\nYes, that's the same result. So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 36120.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can think about this expression as a geometric series or something similar, but given the nested structure, it's probably better to compute step by step as I did.\\n\\nLet me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is 3 times (1 plus the previous result). So, each time, we're doing f(n) = 3(1 + f(n-1)), starting from f(1) = 4.\\n\\nSo, f(1) = 4\\n\\nf(2) = 3(1 + 4) = 15\\n\\nf(3) = 3(1 + 15) = 48\\n\\nf(4) = 3(1 + 48) = 147\\n\\nf(5) = 3(1 + 147) = 444\\n\\nf(6) = 3(1 + 444) = 1335\\n\\nf(7) = 3(1 + 1335) = 4012\\n\\nf(8) = 3(1 + 4012) = 12039\\n\\nf(9) = 3(1 + 12039) = 36120\\n\\nYes, this is consistent with what I did earlier. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 3 times (1 plus the previous term), starting from 4. So, after 9 terms, we get 36120.\\n\\nI don't think I made any calculation errors because each step builds on the previous one correctly, and I verified each step individually. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 36120.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of the expression is \\\\boxed{36120}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the expression \\\\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward step by step.\\n\\n1.

Wait, that's not right.

So the final result is 7,174,452.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula to compute this without going through each step. Let me think about that.\\n\\nLooking at the expression: \\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(\\\\ldots(1 + 3))))))\\\\). It seems like a geometric series or something similar.\\n\\nEach layer is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times \\\\text{previous result}\\\\). So if I denote each step as \\\\(a_n\\\\), where \\\\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\\\), and \\\\(a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n\\\\).\\n\\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation:\\n\\n\\\\(a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n\\\\), with \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\).\\n\\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution can be found.\\n\\nThe homogeneous solution is \\\\(a_n^{(h)} = C \\\\times 3^n\\\\), and a particular solution can be found for the constant term.\\n\\nAssume a particular solution \\\\(a_n^{(p)} = K\\\\), then substituting into the recurrence:\\n\\n\\\\(K = 1 + 3K\\\\)\\n\\nSolving for K: \\\\(K - 3K = 1\\\\) => \\\\(-2K = 1\\\\) => \\\\(K = -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo the general solution is \\\\(a_n = C \\\\times 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nUsing the initial condition \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(4 = C \\\\times 3^1 - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo, \\\\(4 = 3C - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: \\\\(4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = 3C\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(4.5 = 3C\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, \\\\(C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nThus, the general formula is \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\times 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nBut wait, in our problem, how many layers do we have?\\n\\nLooking back at the original expression:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of layers.\\n\\nOriginal expression: \\\\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3:\\n\\nEach \\\"1+3(\\\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n2. \\\\(1 + 3(4) = 13\\\\)\\n3. \\\\(1 + 3(13) = 40\\\\)\\n4. \\\\(1 + 3(40) = 121\\\\)\\n5. \\\\(1 + 3(121) = 364\\\\)\\n6. \\\\(1 + 3(364) = 1093\\\\)\\n7. \\\\(1 + 3(1093) = 3280\\\\)\\n8. \\\\(1 + 3(3280) = 9841\\\\)\\n9. \\\\(1 + 3(9841) = 29524\\\\)\\n10. \\\\(1 + 3(29524) = 88573\\\\)\\n11. \\\\(1 + 3(88573) = 265720\\\\)\\n12. \\\\(1 + 3(265720) = 797161\\\\)\\n13. \\\\(1 + 3(797161) = 2391484\\\\)\\n14. \\\\(3(2391484) = 7174440 + ... Wait, no, that's the outermost multiplication.\\n\\nBut according to the formula, \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\). But in our case, the number of layers is 13 before the outermost 3 is applied.\\n\\nWait, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Let me see.\\n\\nEach layer is defined by \\\\(a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n\\\\). So starting from \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\), each subsequent \\\\(a_n\\\\) is built. So the number of times we apply the recurrence is equal to the number of layers. Since the original expression has 9 innermost layers before the outermost 3, maybe n=9? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\\n\\nLooking at the original expression:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n2. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3)\\\\)\\n3. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\\\\)\\n...\\nEach time, the number of 1+3 increases by one.\\n\\nSo how many 1+3 are there? Let's count the number of \\\"1+3\\\" expressions.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n2. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3)\\\\)\\n3. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\\\\)\\n4. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\\\\)\\n5. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\\\\)\\n6. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\\\\)\\n7. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\\\\)\\n8. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\\\\)\\n9. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1+3 before the outermost 3 is applied. Therefore, n=9.\\n\\nSo, according to the formula \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\), with n=9:\\n\\n\\\\(a_9 = \\\\frac{3^{10}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{59049}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{59048}{2} = 29524\\\\)\\n\\nWait, but according to my earlier step-by-step calculation, after 9 layers, we get 29524. Then, the next layer is \\\\(1 + 3(29524) = 88573\\\\), which is the 10th layer. Then 11th: 265720, 12th: 797161, 13th: 2391484, and then the outermost 3 times that.\\n\\nSo, if I use the formula for n=13, perhaps? Let me see.\\n\\nWait, the formula gives \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\). So for n=9, it gives 29524, which matches the 9th layer. Then each subsequent layer is adding another term. So perhaps after 9 layers, we have 29524, and then we have 4 more layers before applying the outermost 3.\\n\\nWait, but in the original expression, after 9 layers, we have the next operation: \\\\(1 + 3(29524) = 88573\\\\), which is the 10th layer. Then 11th: 265720, 12th: 797161, 13th: 2391484, and then the outermost 3 times that.\\n\\nSo, in total, the number of layers is 13 before the outermost 3. So, is there a way to express this in the formula?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\\\(3 \\\\times a_{13}\\\\), where \\\\(a_{13}\\\\) is the result after 13 layers.\\n\\nBut according to the recurrence, \\\\(a_{n} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\). So, for n=13:\\n\\n\\\\(a_{13} = \\\\frac{3^{14}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nBut \\\\(3^{14}\\\\) is 4782969.\\n\\nSo, \\\\(a_{13} = \\\\frac{4782969}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{4782968}{2} = 2391484\\\\)\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is \\\\(3 \\\\times a_{13} = 3 \\\\times 2391484 = 7174440 + something? Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.\\n\\n2391484 multiplied by 3:\\n\\nLet me compute 2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000\\n\\n300,000 * 3 = 900,000\\n\\n90,000 * 3 = 270,000\\n\\n1,000 * 3 = 3,000\\n\\n400 * 3 = 1,200\\n\\n80 * 3 = 240\\n\\n4 * 3 = 12\\n\\nAdding them up:\\n\\n6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000\\n\\n6,900,000 + 270,000 = 7,170,000\\n\\n7,170,000 + 3,000 = 7,173,000\\n\\n7,173,000 + 1,200 = 7,174,200\\n\\n7,174,200 + 240 = 7,174,440\\n\\n7,174,440 + 12 = 7,174,452\\n\\nSo, the final result is 7,174,452. That matches my step-by-step calculation earlier. So that seems consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost operation is multiplying by 3 after 13 layers, which gives 3 * a_{13} = 3 * ( (3^{14} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{15} - 3)/2.\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3^{15}\\\\):\\n\\n3^1 = 3\\n\\n3^2 = 9\\n\\n3^3 = 27\\n\\n3^4 = 81\\n\\n3^5 = 243\\n\\n3^6 = 729\\n\\n3^7 = 2187\\n\\n3^8 = 6561\\n\\n3^9 = 19683\\n\\n3^10 = 59049\\n\\n3^11 = 177147\\n\\n3^12 = 531441\\n\\n3^13 = 1,594,323\\n\\n3^14 = 4,782,969\\n\\n3^15 = 14,348,907\\n\\nSo, \\\\( (3^{15} - 3)/2 = (14,348,907 - 3)/2 = 14,348,904 / 2 = 7,174,452 \\\\).\\n\\nYes, that's the same result. So, using the formula, it's (3^{15} - 3)/2 = 7,174,452.\\n\\nTherefore, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\\n\\nI think I'm confident that the final answer is 7,174,452.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{7174452}\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

Wait, that's not right. Wait, 2391484 times 3:\\n\\nLet me compute 2,391,484 * 3:\\n\\n2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000\\n\\n300,000 * 3 = 900,000\\n\\n90,000 * 3 = 270,000\\n\\n1,000 * 3 = 3,000\\n\\n400 * 3 = 1,200\\n\\n80 * 3 = 240\\n\\n4 * 3 = 12\\n\\nAdding them up:\\n\\n6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000\\n\\n6,900,000 + 270,000 = 7,170,000\\n\\n7,170,000 + 3,000 = 7,173,000\\n\\n7,173,000 + 1,200 = 7,174,200\\n\\n7,174,200 + 240 = 7,174,440\\n\\n7,174,440 + 12 = 7,174,452\\n\\nYes, so that's correct. So the final result is 7,174,452.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula to compute this without going through each step. Let me think about that.\\n\\nLooking at the expression: \\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(\\\\ldots(1 + 3))))))\\\\). It seems like a geometric series or something similar.\\n\\nEach layer is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times \\\\text{previous result}\\\\). So if I denote each step as \\\\(a_n\\\\), where \\\\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\\\), and \\\\(a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n\\\\).\\n\\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation:\\n\\n\\\\(a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n\\\\), with \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\).\\n\\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution can be found.\\n\\nThe homogeneous solution is \\\\(a_n^{(h)} = C \\\\times 3^n\\\\), and a particular solution can be found for the constant term.\\n\\nAssume a particular solution \\\\(a_n^{(p)} = K\\\\), then substituting into the recurrence:\\n\\n\\\\(K = 1 + 3K\\\\)\\n\\nSolving for K: \\\\(K - 3K = 1\\\\) => \\\\(-2K = 1\\\\) => \\\\(K = -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo the general solution is \\\\(a_n = C \\\\times 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nUsing the initial condition \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(4 = C \\\\times 3^1 - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo, \\\\(4 = 3C - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: \\\\(4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = 3C\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(4.5 = 3C\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, \\\\(C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nThus, the general formula is \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\times 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nBut wait, in our problem, how many layers do we have?\\n\\nLooking back at the original expression:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of layers.\\n\\nOriginal expression: \\\\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3:\\n\\nEach \\\"1+3(\\\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n2. \\\\(1 + 3(4) = 13\\\\)\\n3. \\\\(1 + 3(13) = 40\\\\)\\n4. \\\\(1 + 3(40) = 121\\\\)\\n5. \\\\(1 + 3(121) = 364\\\\)\\n6. \\\\(1 + 3(364) = 1093\\\\)\\n7. \\\\(1 + 3(1093) = 3280\\\\)\\n8. \\\\(1 + 3(3280) = 9841\\\\)\\n9. \\\\(1 + 3(9841) = 29524\\\\)\\n10. \\\\(1 + 3(29524) = 88573\\\\)\\n11. \\\\(1 + 3(88573) = 265720\\\\)\\n12. \\\\(1 + 3(265720) = 797161\\\\)\\n13. \\\\(1 + 3(797161) = 2391484\\\\)\\n14. \\\\(3(2391484) = 7174440 + ... Wait, no, that's the outermost multiplication.\\n\\nBut according to the formula, \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\). But in our case, the number of layers is 13 before the outermost 3 is applied.\\n\\nWait, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Let me see.\\n\\nEach layer is defined by \\\\(a_{n+1} = 1 + 3a_n\\\\). So starting from \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\), each subsequent \\\\(a_n\\\\) is built. So the number of times we apply the recurrence is equal to the number of layers. Since the original expression has 9 innermost layers before the outermost 3, maybe n=9? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\\n\\nLooking at the original expression:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n2. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3)\\\\)\\n3. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\\\\)\\n...\\nEach time, the number of 1+3 increases by one.\\n\\nSo how many 1+3 are there? Let's count the number of \\\"1+3\\\" expressions.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3\\\\)\\n2. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3)\\\\)\\n3. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\\\\)\\n4. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\\\\)\\n5. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\\\\)\\n6. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\\\\)\\n7. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\\\\)\\n8. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\\\\)\\n9. \\\\(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1+3 before the outermost 3 is applied. Therefore, n=9.\\n\\nSo, according to the formula \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\), with n=9:\\n\\n\\\\(a_9 = \\\\frac{3^{10}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{59049}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{59048}{2} = 29524\\\\)\\n\\nWait, but according to my earlier step-by-step calculation, after 9 layers, we get 29524. Then, the next layer is \\\\(1 + 3(29524) = 88573\\\\), which is the 10th layer. Then 11th: 265720, 12th: 797161, 13th: 2391484, and then the outermost 3 times that.\\n\\nSo, if I use the formula for n=13, perhaps? Let me see.\\n\\nWait, the formula gives \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\). So for n=9, it gives 29524, which matches the 9th layer. Then each subsequent layer is adding another term. So perhaps after 9 layers, we have 29524, and then we have 4 more layers before applying the outermost 3.\\n\\nWait, but in the original expression, after 9 layers, we have the next operation: \\\\(1 + 3(29524) = 88573\\\\), which is the 10th layer. Then 11th: 265720, 12th: 797161, 13th: 2391484, and then the outermost 3 times that.\\n\\nSo, in total, the number of layers is 13 before the outermost 3. So, is there a way to express this in the formula?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\\\(3 \\\\times a_{13}\\\\), where \\\\(a_{13}\\\\) is the result after 13 layers.\\n\\nBut according to the recurrence, \\\\(a_{n} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\). So, for n=13:\\n\\n\\\\(a_{13} = \\\\frac{3^{14}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nBut \\\\(3^{14}\\\\) is 4782969.\\n\\nSo, \\\\(a_{13} = \\\\frac{4782969}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{4782968}{2} = 2391484\\\\)\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is \\\\(3 \\\\times a_{13} = 3 \\\\times 2391484 = 7174440 + something? Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.\\n\\n2391484 multiplied by 3:\\n\\nLet me compute 2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000\\n\\n300,000 * 3 = 900,000\\n\\n90,000 * 3 = 270,000\\n\\n1,000 * 3 = 3,000\\n\\n400 * 3 = 1,200\\n\\n80 * 3 = 240\\n\\n4 * 3 = 12\\n\\nAdding them up:\\n\\n6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000\\n\\n6,900,000 + 270,000 = 7,170,000\\n\\n7,170,000 + 3,000 = 7,173,000\\n\\n7,173,000 + 1,200 = 7,174,200\\n\\n7,174,200 + 240 = 7,174,440\\n\\n7,174,440 + 12 = 7,174,452\\n\\nSo, the final result is 7,174,452. That matches my step-by-step calculation earlier. So that seems consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost operation is multiplying by 3 after 13 layers, which gives 3 * a_{13} = 3 * ( (3^{14} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{15} - 3)/2.\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3^{15}\\\\):\\n\\n3^1 = 3\\n\\n3^2 = 9\\n\\n3^3 = 27\\n\\n3^4 = 81\\n\\n3^5 = 243\\n\\n3^6 = 729\\n\\n3^7 = 2187\\n\\n3^8 = 6561\\n\\n3^9 = 19683\\n\\n3^10 = 59049\\n\\n3^11 = 177147\\n\\n3^12 = 531441\\n\\n3^13 = 1,594,323\\n\\n3^14 = 4,782,969\\n\\n3^15 = 14,348,907\\n\\nSo, \\\\( (3^{15} - 3)/2 = (14,348,907 - 3)/2 = 14,348,904 / 2 = 7,174,452 \\\\).\\n\\nYes, that's the same result. So, using the formula, it's (3^{15} - 3)/2 = 7,174,452.\\n\\nTherefore, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\\n\\nI think I'm confident that the final answer is 7,174,452.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{7174452}\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

Let me check the original problem again:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \\\"1 + 3(\\\" is a layer, and how many are there?

But the original expression ends with 1 + 3, so maybe that's the ninth layer, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. So, in total, I think we have eight multiplications by 3, each time adding a new layer. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\\n\\nSo, starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\\n\\nWait, so if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\\n\\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3.\\n\\nCompute 29524 * 3:\\n\\n24 * 3 = 72, carry over 7.\\n\\n5 * 3 = 15, plus 7 is 22, carry over 2.\\n\\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\\n\\n9 * 3 = 27.\\n\\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\\n\\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\\n\\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\\n\\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\\n\\n500 * 3 = 1,500\\n\\n24 * 3 = 72\\n\\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\\n\\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\\n\\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. Because in the original expression, the number of \\\"1 + 3(\\\" is actually nine, right? Let's count the number of \\\"1 + 3(\\\" in the original problem:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nStarting from the innermost, each \\\"1 + 3(\\\" is a new layer, and there are nine of them. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9.\\n\\nTherefore, my calculation above is correct, ending with Layer 9 as 29524, multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me just verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error somewhere.\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.\\n\\nSo, then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but I just thought, is the outermost operation 3*(...)? Yes, that's correct.\\n\\nSo, 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression, which after nine layers is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer should be 88,572.\\n\\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\\n\\nYes, that's the same as before.\\n\\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, just to double-check, perhaps I can compute it another way. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions.\\n\\nLooking at the structure, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It's similar to a geometric series or something recursive.\\n\\nLet me consider the general form: Let\\u2019s denote S(n) as the expression with n layers.\\n\\nSo, S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nSo, it's a recursive relation: S(n) = 3*S(n-1) + 1.\\n\\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\\n\\nThe recurrence is S(n) = 3*S(n-1) + 1.\\n\\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is S(n) = 3*S(n-1), which has the solution S(n) = C*3^n.\\n\\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution S_p.\\n\\nAssume S_p = K.\\n\\nThen, substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\\n\\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is S(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\\n\\nUsing the initial condition S(1) = 4:\\n\\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\\n\\nTherefore, S(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\\n\\nSo, the closed-form expression is S(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\\n\\nTherefore, for our problem, n=9 layers.\\n\\nThus, S(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\\n\\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\\n\\nSo, S(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\\n\\nYes, that matches our earlier calculation. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\\n\\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\\n\\nSo, the computed value is 88,572.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can verify this by computing each layer using the closed-form formula:\\n\\nS(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\\n\\nSo, for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which is correct.\\n\\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, correct.\\n\\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct.\\n\\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\\n\\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\\n\\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\\n\\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\\n\\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\\n\\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\\n\\nSo, the closed-form formula works perfectly.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but just to ensure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial step-by-step computation, I'll redo it once more.\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\\n\\nYes, same result.\\n\\nTherefore, 3*29524 = 88,572.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can compute 3*29524 as follows:\\n\\n29524 * 3:\\n\\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\\n\\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\\n\\n500 * 3 = 1,500\\n\\n24 * 3 = 72\\n\\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\\n\\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\\n\\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\\n\\nYes, correct.\\n\\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying with a closed-form formula, and cross-checking the arithmetic, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of the expression is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given expression, we start by breaking it down layer by layer, beginning from the innermost parentheses.

Let me count:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3\\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\\n\\nWait, so that's actually nine layers. But the original expression ends with 1 + 3, so maybe that's the ninth layer, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. So, in total, I think we have eight multiplications by 3, each time adding a new layer. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\\n\\nSo, starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\\n\\nWait, so if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\\n\\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3.\\n\\nCompute 29524 * 3:\\n\\n24 * 3 = 72, carry over 7.\\n\\n5 * 3 = 15, plus 7 is 22, carry over 2.\\n\\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\\n\\n9 * 3 = 27.\\n\\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\\n\\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\\n\\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\\n\\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\\n\\n500 * 3 = 1,500\\n\\n24 * 3 = 72\\n\\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\\n\\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\\n\\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. Because in the original expression, the number of \\\"1 + 3(\\\" is actually nine, right? Let's count the number of \\\"1 + 3(\\\" in the original problem:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nStarting from the innermost, each \\\"1 + 3(\\\" is a new layer, and there are nine of them. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9.\\n\\nTherefore, my calculation above is correct, ending with Layer 9 as 29524, multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me just verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error somewhere.\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.\\n\\nSo, then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but I just thought, is the outermost operation 3*(...)? Yes, that's correct.\\n\\nSo, 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression, which after nine layers is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer should be 88,572.\\n\\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\\n\\nYes, that's the same as before.\\n\\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, just to double-check, perhaps I can compute it another way. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions.\\n\\nLooking at the structure, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It's similar to a geometric series or something recursive.\\n\\nLet me consider the general form: Let\\u2019s denote S(n) as the expression with n layers.\\n\\nSo, S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nSo, it's a recursive relation: S(n) = 3*S(n-1) + 1.\\n\\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\\n\\nThe recurrence is S(n) = 3*S(n-1) + 1.\\n\\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is S(n) = 3*S(n-1), which has the solution S(n) = C*3^n.\\n\\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution S_p.\\n\\nAssume S_p = K.\\n\\nThen, substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\\n\\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is S(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\\n\\nUsing the initial condition S(1) = 4:\\n\\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\\n\\nTherefore, S(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\\n\\nSo, the closed-form expression is S(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\\n\\nTherefore, for our problem, n=9 layers.\\n\\nThus, S(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\\n\\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\\n\\nSo, S(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\\n\\nYes, that matches our earlier calculation. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\\n\\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\\n\\nSo, the computed value is 88,572.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can verify this by computing each layer using the closed-form formula:\\n\\nS(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\\n\\nSo, for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which is correct.\\n\\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, correct.\\n\\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct.\\n\\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\\n\\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\\n\\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\\n\\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\\n\\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\\n\\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\\n\\nSo, the closed-form formula works perfectly.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but just to ensure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial step-by-step computation, I'll redo it once more.\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\\n\\nYes, same result.\\n\\nTherefore, 3*29524 = 88,572.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can compute 3*29524 as follows:\\n\\n29524 * 3:\\n\\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\\n\\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\\n\\n500 * 3 = 1,500\\n\\n24 * 3 = 72\\n\\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\\n\\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\\n\\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\\n\\nYes, correct.\\n\\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying with a closed-form formula, and cross-checking the arithmetic, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of the expression is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given expression, we start by breaking it down layer by layer, beginning from the innermost parentheses.

Let me write it down to see it more clearly:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nWow, okay. That's a lot of threes and ones and parentheses. I need to compute this step by step. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\\n\\nSo, the innermost part is at the very end of the expression: 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nAlright, so that simplifies the innermost part. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3(1 + 3). Wait, hold on, I need to be careful here. Let me make sure I'm replacing the innermost parentheses correctly.\\n\\nActually, let me parse the entire expression step by step, starting from the inside.\\n\\nLet me number the layers to keep track:\\n\\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3\\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3)\\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4)\\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5)\\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6)\\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7)\\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\\n10. Layer 10: 1 + 3(Layer 9)\\n\\nThen, each of these layers is multiplied by 3, starting from the outermost layer.

Wait, the structure is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...(1 + 3))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and each layer is one level deeper.

So, starting from 1 + 3 = 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, then 1 + 3*40 = 121, then 1 + 3*121 = 364, then 1 + 3*364 = 1,093, then 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280, then 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841, then 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524, then 1 + 3*29,524 = 88,573.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct.

Problem: Compute\\n\\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ Solution: \\n<think>\\nAlright, so I've got this math problem here, and it's a bit of a mouthful. It looks like a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Let me write it down to see it more clearly:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nWow, okay. That's a lot of threes and ones and parentheses. I need to compute this step by step. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\\n\\nSo, the innermost part is at the very end of the expression: 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nAlright, so that simplifies the innermost part. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3(1 + 3). Wait, hold on, I need to be careful here. Let me make sure I'm replacing the innermost parentheses correctly.\\n\\nActually, let me parse the entire expression step by step, starting from the inside.\\n\\nLet me number the layers to keep track:\\n\\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3\\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3)\\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4)\\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5)\\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6)\\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7)\\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\\n10. Layer 10: 1 + 3(Layer 9)\\n\\nThen, each of these layers is multiplied by 3, starting from the outermost layer. So, Layer 10 is multiplied by 3, Layer 9 is multiplied by 3, and so on, until the first 3 is multiplied by Layer 1.\\n\\nWait, actually, looking back at the original expression:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nThen, moving outward, Layer 2 is 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\\n\\nWait, is that correct? Let me check.\\n\\nYes, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*Layer9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\n\\nOkay, so Layer 10 is 88,573. Now, moving outward, each of these layers is multiplied by 3, starting from the outermost 3.\\n\\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10). Wait, is that correct?\\n\\nWait, let me look at the original expression again:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing Layer 10 as 88,573, then the next operation is 1 + 3*Layer10, which would be 1 + 3*88,573.\\n\\nWait, hold on, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount.\\n\\nWait, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13.\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 39 = 40.\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 120 = 121.\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 363 = 364.\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\\n\\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer9) = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\\n\\nSo, Layer 10 is 88,573.\\n\\nBut then, looking back at the original expression, after Layer 10, we have another set of parentheses, but in the original problem, it seems like the outermost operation is 3*(...), so after Layer 10, is there another layer?\\n\\nWait, let me count the number of parentheses.\\n\\nThe expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nLet me count the number of \\\"1 + 3(\\\" sections. Starting from the innermost, each \\\"1 + 3(\\\" is a layer.\\n\\nFrom the end, moving inwards:\\n\\n1 + 3\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3(1 + 3)\\n\\nThen, 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\\n\\nAnd so on, until the outermost is 3(...).\\n\\nSo, how many layers are there?\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer1)\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer2)\\n\\n...\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3(Layer8)\\n\\nLayer 10: 1 + 3(Layer9)\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer10)\\n\\nSo, that's correct. So, Layer 10 is 88,573, and then the entire expression is 3*88,573.\\n\\nWait, let me confirm that.\\n\\nWait, actually, no. Wait, the structure is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...(1 + 3))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and each layer is one level deeper. So, the innermost is Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n\\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n\\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n\\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\\n\\nLayer10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer10) = 3*88573.\\n\\nWait, but hold on. The outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of Layer10.\\n\\nTherefore, 3*88573.\\n\\nLet me compute that.\\n\\n3*88,573.\\n\\nFirst, 3*80,000 = 240,000\\n\\n3*5,573 = ?\\n\\nCompute 3*5,000 = 15,000\\n\\n3*573 = 1,719\\n\\nSo, 15,000 + 1,719 = 16,719\\n\\nThen, 240,000 + 16,719 = 256,719\\n\\nWait, that seems like a big number.

So, starting from 1 + 3 = 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, then 1 + 3*40 = 121, then 1 + 3*121 = 364, then 1 + 3*364 = 1,093, then 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280, then 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841, then 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524, then 1 + 3*29,524 = 88,573.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3 multiplied by that is 256,719.\\n\\nHmm. That seems like a lot, but considering there are nine layers, each multiplying by 3, it's plausible.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help compute this without doing each layer step by step.

It looks like a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times something, and it goes on for quite a few layers. I need to figure out a systematic way to simplify this without getting lost in the layers.\\n\\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built using multiple layers of the same pattern: 3 times something that starts with 1 plus another 3 times something. This repetition suggests that there might be a pattern or a recursive formula I can use to simplify it.\\n\\nLet me write down the expression step by step to see the structure better:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost part:\\n\\n1.

Let me check the number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers as per the initial count. But I have gone up to Layer 17. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Let me recount the layers in the original problem.\\n\\nLooking back at the original expression:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3\\\\) \\u2013 that's the innermost, so Layer 1.\\n\\nThen each subsequent 3 adds another layer. Let's count the number of 3s:\\n\\nStarting from the left:\\n\\n1. The first 3 is at the very beginning: 3(...)\\n\\nThen each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. So let's count them:\\n\\n1. First 3: at the very beginning.\\n\\n2. Next 3: after the first opening parenthesis.\\n\\n3. Then another 3 inside the next parentheses.\\n\\nContinuing this way, let's see:\\n\\nOriginal expression:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nCount the number of 3s:\\n\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3)\\n- )))))\\n\\nWait, that's 9 layers. So I think I miscounted earlier. So starting from the innermost, each 3 corresponds to a layer.\\n\\nWait, actually, perhaps I should think of each opening parenthesis as a new layer. Let's see:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3\\\\) \\u2013 Layer 1.\\n\\n2. Moving outward: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Layer 1 result})\\\\) \\u2013 Layer 2.\\n\\n3. Next: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Layer 2 result})\\\\) \\u2013 Layer 3.\\n\\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer.\\n\\nGiven that, the original expression has 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. So that would be 9 layers. But in my earlier computation, I went up to Layer 17, which is way too many. So I must have miscounted.\\n\\nLet me re-examine the original expression:\\n\\nCompute:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nLet me count the number of 3s:\\n\\nStarting from the left:\\n\\n1. The first 3 is at the very beginning.\\n\\nThen, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses.\\n\\nSo, breaking it down:\\n\\n- 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3)\\n- )))))\\n\\nSo, each 3 is followed by another set of parentheses, except for the innermost one, which is just 1 + 3.\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = Layer 1.\\n\\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result) = Layer 2.\\n\\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = Layer 3.\\n\\n4. Continuing this way until the outermost layer, which is Layer 9.\\n\\nSo, total layers: 9.\\n\\nTherefore, my earlier computation went beyond that. I mistakenly counted more layers. Let me correct that.\\n\\nSo, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9.\\n\\nLet me recompute correctly:\\n\\n**Layer 1 (Innermost):**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 1 result: 4\\n\\n**Layer 2:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 2 result: 13\\n\\n**Layer 3:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 3 result: 40\\n\\n**Layer 4:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 4 result: 121\\n\\n**Layer 5:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 5 result: 364\\n\\n**Layer 6:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 6 result: 1,093\\n\\n**Layer 7:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 7 result: 3,280\\n\\n**Layer 8:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 8 result: 9,841\\n\\n**Layer 9:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 9 result: 29,524\\n\\nWait, but the original expression is:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nSo, after computing Layer 9, we have to multiply by the outermost 3.\\n\\nSo, after Layer 9, which is 29,524, we have to compute:\\n\\n3*(Layer 9 result) = 3*29,524\\n\\nCompute that:\\n\\n3*29,524 = 88,572\\n\\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I haven't missed any layers.\\n\\nWait, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the one just before the outermost 3. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result). So, 3*(29,524) = 88,572\\n\\nBut wait, in my initial computation, I went beyond Layer 9 because I miscounted. So, the correct process is:\\n\\nCompute each layer from 1 to 9, then multiply by 3 at the end.\\n\\nSo, let me confirm:\\n\\nAfter Layer 9, which is 29,524, we have to multiply by 3:\\n\\n3 * 29,524 = ?\\n\\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\\n\\n29,524 * 3:\\n\\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1.\\n\\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\\n\\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1.\\n\\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2.\\n\\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nSo, writing it down:\\n\\n29,524\\n\\n*         3\\n\\n------------\\n\\n88,572\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nSo, the total computation is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me think again. Is that all? Or is there another layer?\\n\\nWait, the original expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, the structure is 3 times something, where that something is 1 + 3 times another similar expression. So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)).\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1). Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3:1 + 3*13=40, etc., up to Layer 9:29,524. Then, the outermost 3 multiplies that: 3*29,524=88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me think again. Sometimes, in these problems, people use a formula to represent such recursive expressions. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step.\\n\\nLooking at the expression, it seems like each layer is of the form:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\\\)\\n\\nWhere \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\) (since innermost is 1 + 3 = 4).\\n\\nSo, the sequence is defined recursively as:\\n\\n\\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\\\)\\n\\nAnd we need to find \\\\(a_9\\\\), then multiply by 3.\\n\\nWait, so the outermost operation is 3*(a_9). So, if I compute a_1 through a_9, then multiply by 3.\\n\\nBut in my earlier computation, I did a_1 to a_9, and then multiplied by 3, getting 88,572.\\n\\nBut let me confirm the number of layers.\\n\\nOriginal expression:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\\n\\nStarting from the left:\\n\\n1. 3(\\n2. 1 + 3(\\n3. 1 + 3(\\n4. 1 + 3(\\n5. 1 + 3(\\n6. 1 + 3(\\n7. 1 + 3(\\n8. 1 + 3(\\n9. 1 + 3(\\n10. 1 + 3)\\n11. )))))\\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, but actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, so the number of layers is 9.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the outermost 3 is included in the layers.\\n\\nWait, the expression is 3 times (something). The something is a nested expression with 9 layers, so a_9. Therefore, total computation is 3*a_9.\\n\\nYes, so in my computation, a_9 is 29,524, so 3*29,524=88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nBut to make sure, let me compute the sequence a_n step by step:\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\n\\\\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\\\)\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of recursive sequence.\\n\\nGiven the recursive formula:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\\\)\\n\\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\\n\\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = C \\\\cdot 3^n + \\\\frac{1}{1 - 3} (1 - 3^n)\\\\)\\n\\nWait, let me recall the formula.\\n\\nFor a recurrence relation of the form:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = c \\\\cdot a_{n-1} + d\\\\)\\n\\nThe general solution is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = A \\\\cdot c^n + \\\\frac{d}{1 - c}\\\\)\\n\\nIn our case, \\\\(c = 3\\\\) and \\\\(d = 1\\\\), so:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = A \\\\cdot 3^n + \\\\frac{1}{1 - 3} = A \\\\cdot 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nNow, we need to find A using the initial condition.\\n\\nGiven that \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(4 = A \\\\cdot 3^1 - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n\\\\(4 = 3A - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSolving for A:\\n\\n\\\\(3A = 4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nThus,\\n\\n\\\\(A = \\\\frac{9}{2} / 3 = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, the general formula is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\cdot 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\\n\\n\\\\(a_1 = \\\\frac{3^{2} - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{9 - 1}{2} = 4\\\\), which matches.\\n\\nSimilarly, n=2:\\n\\n\\\\(a_2 = \\\\frac{3^{3} - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{27 - 1}{2} = 13\\\\), which matches.\\n\\nGood, seems correct.\\n\\nTherefore, general term is \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, for n=9:\\n\\n\\\\(a_9 = \\\\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3^{10}\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(3^1 = 3\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^2 = 9\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^3 = 27\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^4 = 81\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^5 = 243\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^6 = 729\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^7 = 2,187\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^8 = 6,561\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^9 = 19,683\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^{10} = 59,049\\\\)\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n\\\\(a_9 = \\\\frac{59,049 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{59,048}{2} = 29,524\\\\)\\n\\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\\n\\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, to be thorough, let me compute 3*29,524:\\n\\n29,524 * 3:\\n\\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\\n\\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\\n\\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\\n\\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\\n\\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nSo, 88,572.\\n\\nYes, correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a multiple of 3^n, but the general formula approach seems more efficient.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{88572}\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given expression step by step:\\n\\nThe expression is:\\n\\\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\]\\n\\nWe start from the innermost layer and work our way out.

Let me check the number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers as per the initial count. But I have gone up to Layer 17. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Let me recount the layers in the original problem.\\n\\nLooking back at the original expression:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3\\\\) \\u2013 that's the innermost, so Layer 1.\\n\\nThen each subsequent 3 adds another layer. Let's count the number of 3s:\\n\\nStarting from the left:\\n\\n1. The first 3 is at the very beginning: 3(...)\\n\\nThen each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. So let's count them:\\n\\n1. First 3: at the very beginning.\\n\\n2. Next 3: after the first opening parenthesis.\\n\\n3. Then another 3 inside the next parentheses.\\n\\nContinuing this way, let's see:\\n\\nOriginal expression:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nCount the number of 3s:\\n\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3(\\n- 3)\\n- )))))\\n\\nWait, that's 9 layers. So I think I miscounted earlier. So starting from the innermost, each 3 corresponds to a layer.\\n\\nWait, actually, perhaps I should think of each opening parenthesis as a new layer. Let's see:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3\\\\) \\u2013 Layer 1.\\n\\n2. Moving outward: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Layer 1 result})\\\\) \\u2013 Layer 2.\\n\\n3. Next: \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{Layer 2 result})\\\\) \\u2013 Layer 3.\\n\\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer.\\n\\nGiven that, the original expression has 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. So that would be 9 layers. But in my earlier computation, I went up to Layer 17, which is way too many. So I must have miscounted.\\n\\nLet me re-examine the original expression:\\n\\nCompute:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nLet me count the number of 3s:\\n\\nStarting from the left:\\n\\n1. The first 3 is at the very beginning.\\n\\nThen, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses.\\n\\nSo, breaking it down:\\n\\n- 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3(\\n- 1 + 3)\\n- )))))\\n\\nSo, each 3 is followed by another set of parentheses, except for the innermost one, which is just 1 + 3.\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = Layer 1.\\n\\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result) = Layer 2.\\n\\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = Layer 3.\\n\\n4. Continuing this way until the outermost layer, which is Layer 9.\\n\\nSo, total layers: 9.\\n\\nTherefore, my earlier computation went beyond that. I mistakenly counted more layers. Let me correct that.\\n\\nSo, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9.\\n\\nLet me recompute correctly:\\n\\n**Layer 1 (Innermost):**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 1 result: 4\\n\\n**Layer 2:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 2 result: 13\\n\\n**Layer 3:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 3 result: 40\\n\\n**Layer 4:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 4 result: 121\\n\\n**Layer 5:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 5 result: 364\\n\\n**Layer 6:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 6 result: 1,093\\n\\n**Layer 7:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 7 result: 3,280\\n\\n**Layer 8:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 8 result: 9,841\\n\\n**Layer 9:**\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 9 result: 29,524\\n\\nWait, but the original expression is:\\n\\n\\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nSo, after computing Layer 9, we have to multiply by the outermost 3.\\n\\nSo, after Layer 9, which is 29,524, we have to compute:\\n\\n3*(Layer 9 result) = 3*29,524\\n\\nCompute that:\\n\\n3*29,524 = 88,572\\n\\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I haven't missed any layers.\\n\\nWait, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the one just before the outermost 3. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result). So, 3*(29,524) = 88,572\\n\\nBut wait, in my initial computation, I went beyond Layer 9 because I miscounted. So, the correct process is:\\n\\nCompute each layer from 1 to 9, then multiply by 3 at the end.\\n\\nSo, let me confirm:\\n\\nAfter Layer 9, which is 29,524, we have to multiply by 3:\\n\\n3 * 29,524 = ?\\n\\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\\n\\n29,524 * 3:\\n\\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1.\\n\\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\\n\\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1.\\n\\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2.\\n\\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nSo, writing it down:\\n\\n29,524\\n\\n*         3\\n\\n------------\\n\\n88,572\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nSo, the total computation is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me think again. Is that all? Or is there another layer?\\n\\nWait, the original expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, the structure is 3 times something, where that something is 1 + 3 times another similar expression. So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)).\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1). Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3:1 + 3*13=40, etc., up to Layer 9:29,524. Then, the outermost 3 multiplies that: 3*29,524=88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me think again. Sometimes, in these problems, people use a formula to represent such recursive expressions. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step.\\n\\nLooking at the expression, it seems like each layer is of the form:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\\\)\\n\\nWhere \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\) (since innermost is 1 + 3 = 4).\\n\\nSo, the sequence is defined recursively as:\\n\\n\\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\\\)\\n\\nAnd we need to find \\\\(a_9\\\\), then multiply by 3.\\n\\nWait, so the outermost operation is 3*(a_9). So, if I compute a_1 through a_9, then multiply by 3.\\n\\nBut in my earlier computation, I did a_1 to a_9, and then multiplied by 3, getting 88,572.\\n\\nBut let me confirm the number of layers.\\n\\nOriginal expression:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\\n\\nStarting from the left:\\n\\n1. 3(\\n2. 1 + 3(\\n3. 1 + 3(\\n4. 1 + 3(\\n5. 1 + 3(\\n6. 1 + 3(\\n7. 1 + 3(\\n8. 1 + 3(\\n9. 1 + 3(\\n10. 1 + 3)\\n11. )))))\\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, but actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, so the number of layers is 9.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the outermost 3 is included in the layers.\\n\\nWait, the expression is 3 times (something). The something is a nested expression with 9 layers, so a_9. Therefore, total computation is 3*a_9.\\n\\nYes, so in my computation, a_9 is 29,524, so 3*29,524=88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nBut to make sure, let me compute the sequence a_n step by step:\\n\\nGiven:\\n\\n\\\\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\\\)\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of recursive sequence.\\n\\nGiven the recursive formula:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\\\)\\n\\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\\n\\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = C \\\\cdot 3^n + \\\\frac{1}{1 - 3} (1 - 3^n)\\\\)\\n\\nWait, let me recall the formula.\\n\\nFor a recurrence relation of the form:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = c \\\\cdot a_{n-1} + d\\\\)\\n\\nThe general solution is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = A \\\\cdot c^n + \\\\frac{d}{1 - c}\\\\)\\n\\nIn our case, \\\\(c = 3\\\\) and \\\\(d = 1\\\\), so:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = A \\\\cdot 3^n + \\\\frac{1}{1 - 3} = A \\\\cdot 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nNow, we need to find A using the initial condition.\\n\\nGiven that \\\\(a_1 = 4\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(4 = A \\\\cdot 3^1 - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n\\\\(4 = 3A - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSolving for A:\\n\\n\\\\(3A = 4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{9}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nThus,\\n\\n\\\\(A = \\\\frac{9}{2} / 3 = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, the general formula is:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\cdot 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n\\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\\n\\n\\\\(a_1 = \\\\frac{3^{2} - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{9 - 1}{2} = 4\\\\), which matches.\\n\\nSimilarly, n=2:\\n\\n\\\\(a_2 = \\\\frac{3^{3} - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{27 - 1}{2} = 13\\\\), which matches.\\n\\nGood, seems correct.\\n\\nTherefore, general term is \\\\(a_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, for n=9:\\n\\n\\\\(a_9 = \\\\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3^{10}\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(3^1 = 3\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^2 = 9\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^3 = 27\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^4 = 81\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^5 = 243\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^6 = 729\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^7 = 2,187\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^8 = 6,561\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^9 = 19,683\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^{10} = 59,049\\\\)\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n\\\\(a_9 = \\\\frac{59,049 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{59,048}{2} = 29,524\\\\)\\n\\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\\n\\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nBut wait, to be thorough, let me compute 3*29,524:\\n\\n29,524 * 3:\\n\\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\\n\\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\\n\\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\\n\\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\\n\\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\\n\\nSo, 88,572.\\n\\nYes, correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a multiple of 3^n, but the general formula approach seems more efficient.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{88572}\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given expression step by step:\\n\\nThe expression is:\\n\\\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\]\\n\\nWe start from the innermost layer and work our way out.

      "    \"rollout\": \"Alright, so I have this math problem here that I need to solve. It looks a bit complicated at first glance with all those parentheses, but I think I can break it down step by step. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nHmm, okay. So, it's a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. Each layer seems to have a 3 multiplied by something, and then that something is 1 plus another 3 times something else. It seems recursive in a way. Maybe I can tackle this by working from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually helps with nested expressions.\\n\\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part. The innermost parentheses are the ones right at the end. So, looking closely, the innermost expression is \\\\(1 + 3\\\\). Let me compute that first.\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. Compute \\\\(1 + 3\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost parentheses. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times \\\\) whatever was just computed. So, replacing the innermost parentheses with 4, we get:\\n\\n2. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4\\\\):\\n\\nFirst, compute the multiplication: \\\\(3 \\\\times 4 = 12\\\\)\\n\\nThen add 1: \\\\(1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n\\nAlright, so that middle layer simplifies to 13. Let me replace that in the expression. Moving one layer out, the next expression is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13\\\\). Let me compute that.\\n\\n3. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13\\\\):\\n\\nFirst, compute the multiplication: \\\\(3 \\\\times 13 = 39\\\\)\\n\\nThen add 1: \\\\(1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n\\nSo, that layer simplifies to 40. Replacing that, the next layer is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 40\\\\). Let me do that.\\n\\n4. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 40\\\\):\\n\\nMultiplication first: \\\\(3 \\\\times 40 = 120\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n\\nAlright, so that's 121. Moving out another layer, the next expression is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 121\\\\). Let me compute that.\\n\\n5. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 121\\\\):\\n\\nMultiply: \\\\(3 \\\\times 121 = 363\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 363 = 364\\\\)\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 364. Replacing that, the next layer is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 364\\\\). Let's compute this.\\n\\n6. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 364\\\\):\\n\\nMultiply: \\\\(3 \\\\times 364 = 1092\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\)\\n\\nGot it, 1093. Moving outward, the next expression is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 1093\\\\). Let me compute that.\\n\\n7. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 1093\\\\):\\n\\nMultiply: \\\\(3 \\\\times 1093 = 3279\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\)\\n\\nOkay, so that's 3280. Next layer is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3280\\\\). Let's do that.\\n\\n8. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3280\\\\):\\n\\nMultiply: \\\\(3 \\\\times 3280 = 9840\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\)\\n\\nAlright, 9841. Moving out another layer, the next expression is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 9841\\\\). Let me calculate that.\\n\\n9. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 9841\\\\):\\n\\nMultiply: \\\\(3 \\\\times 9841 = 29523\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 29523 = 29524\\\\)\\n\\nSo, that gives me 29524. Now, moving out to the next layer, which is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 29524\\\\). Let me compute this.\\n\\n10. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 29524\\\\):\\n\\nMultiply: \\\\(3 \\\\times 29524 = 88572\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 88572 = 88573\\\\)\\n\\nAlright, so that's 88573. Now, the next layer is the outermost one, which is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 88573\\\\). Let me compute that.\\n\\n11. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 88573\\\\):\\n\\nMultiply: \\\\(3 \\\\times 88573 = 265719\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 265719 = 265720\\\\)\\n\\nOkay, so after simplifying each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, I end up with 265720.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic mistake when dealing with large numbers.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n2. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n3. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n4. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n5. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n6. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n7. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n8. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n9. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n10. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n11. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\nOkay, each step seems to check out. So, I think 265720 is the correct answer.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Maybe recognizing that each layer is a function of the previous one. Let me denote each expression as \\\\(E_n\\\\), where n is the number of layers.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n- \\\\(E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n- \\\\(E_2 = 1 + 3 \\\\times E_1 = 1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 13\\\\)\\n- \\\\(E_3 = 1 + 3 \\\\times E_2 = 1 + 3 \\\\times 13 = 40\\\\)\\n- \\\\(E_4 = 1 + 3 \\\\times E_3 = 1 + 3 \\\\times 40 = 121\\\\)\\n- \\\\(E_5 = 1 + 3 \\\\times E_4 = 1 + 3 \\\\times 121 = 364\\\\)\\n- \\\\(E_6 = 1 + 3 \\\\times E_5 = 1 + 3 \\\\times 364 = 1093\\\\)\\n- \\\\(E_7 = 1 + 3 \\\\times E_6 = 1 + 3 \\\\times 1093 = 3280\\\\)\\n- \\\\(E_8 = 1 + 3 \\\\times E_7 = 1 + 3 \\\\times 3280 = 9841\\\\)\\n- \\\\(E_9 = 1 + 3 \\\\times E_8 = 1 + 3 \\\\times 9841 = 29524\\\\)\\n- \\\\(E_{10} = 1 + 3 \\\\times E_9 = 1 + 3 \\\\times 29524 = 88573\\\\)\\n- \\\\(E_{11} = 1 + 3 \\\\times E_{10} = 1 + 3 \\\\times 88573 = 265720\\\\)\\n\\nYep, same result. So, whether I compute step by step or define each layer recursively, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that 265720 is the correct result.\\n\\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each step is a linear transformation. Each \\\\(E_n = 3E_{n-1} + 1\\\\). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrences.\\n\\nThe general form of a linear recurrence is \\\\(E_n = aE_{n-1} + b\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants. In this case, \\\\(a = 3\\\\) and \\\\(b = 1\\\\).\\n\\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula:\\n\\n\\\\(E_n = a^{n}E_0 + \\\\frac{b(a^{n} - 1)}{a - 1}\\\\)\\n\\nBut in our case, the starting point is \\\\(E_1 = 4\\\\), not \\\\(E_0\\\\). Let me adjust the formula accordingly.\\n\\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution is \\\\(E_n^{(h)} = C \\\\times 3^n\\\\), and the particular solution can be found for the constant term.\\n\\nLet me set up the equation \\\\(E_n = 3E_{n-1} + 1\\\\). The homogeneous solution is \\\\(C \\\\times 3^n\\\\). For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution \\\\(E_p\\\\).\\n\\nPlugging into the recurrence:\\n\\n\\\\(E_p = 3E_p + 1\\\\)\\n\\nSolving for \\\\(E_p\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(E_p - 3E_p = 1\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(-2E_p = 1\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(E_p = -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSo, the general solution is \\\\(E_n = C \\\\times 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\).\\n\\nNow, apply the initial condition. At \\\\(n = 1\\\\), \\\\(E_1 = 4\\\\).\\n\\n\\\\(4 = C \\\\times 3^1 - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(4 = 3C - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nAdd \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\) to both sides:\\n\\n\\\\(4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} = 3C\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(\\\\frac{9}{2} = 3C\\\\)\\n\\nMultiply both sides by \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(C = \\\\frac{9}{2} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{3} = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is:\\n\\n\\\\(E_n = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\times 3^n - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\n\\\\(E_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nOr,\\n\\n\\\\(E_n = \\\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nNow, let's test this formula with \\\\(n = 1\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(E_1 = \\\\frac{3^{2} - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{9 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{8}{2} = 4\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\nSimilarly, \\\\(n = 2\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(E_2 = \\\\frac{3^{3} - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{27 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{26}{2} = 13\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\nGood, it works for the first few terms. So, for \\\\(n = 11\\\\), which is the number of layers we have in the original problem, let's compute \\\\(E_{11}\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(E_{11} = \\\\frac{3^{12} - 1}{2}\\\\)\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3^{12}\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(3^1 = 3\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^2 = 9\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^3 = 27\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^4 = 81\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^5 = 243\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^6 = 729\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^7 = 2187\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^8 = 6561\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^9 = 19683\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^{10} = 59049\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^{11} = 177147\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(3^{12} = 531441\\\\)\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n\\\\(E_{11} = \\\\frac{531441 - 1}{2} = \\\\frac{531440}{2} = 265720\\\\)\\n\\nPerfect! So, using the recurrence relation, I also arrive at the same result, 265720. This gives me even more confidence that my answer is correct.\\n\\nIn summary, whether I compute each layer step by step, recognize the recurrence relation, or use the formula derived from the linear recurrence, the result is consistent.

Problem: Compute\\n\\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ Solution: \\n<think>\\nAlright, so I have this math problem here that I need to solve. It looks a bit complicated at first glance with all those parentheses, but I think I can break it down step by step. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\\n\\nCompute \\\\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\\\)\\n\\nHmm, okay. So, it's a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. Each layer seems to have a 3 multiplied by something, and then that something is 1 plus another 3 times something else. It seems recursive in a way. Maybe I can tackle this by working from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually helps with nested expressions.\\n\\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part. The innermost parentheses are the ones right at the end. So, looking closely, the innermost expression is \\\\(1 + 3\\\\). Let me compute that first.\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. Compute \\\\(1 + 3\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost parentheses. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times \\\\) whatever was just computed. So, replacing the innermost parentheses with 4, we get:\\n\\n2. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4\\\\):\\n\\nFirst, compute the multiplication: \\\\(3 \\\\times 4 = 12\\\\)\\n\\nThen add 1: \\\\(1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n\\nAlright, so that middle layer simplifies to 13. Let me replace that in the expression. Moving one layer out, the next expression is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13\\\\). Let me compute that.\\n\\n3. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13\\\\):\\n\\nFirst, compute the multiplication: \\\\(3 \\\\times 13 = 39\\\\)\\n\\nThen add 1: \\\\(1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n\\nSo, that layer simplifies to 40. Replacing that, the next layer is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 40\\\\). Let me do that.\\n\\n4. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 40\\\\):\\n\\nMultiplication first: \\\\(3 \\\\times 40 = 120\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n\\nAlright, so that's 121. Moving out another layer, the next expression is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 121\\\\). Let me compute that.\\n\\n5. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 121\\\\):\\n\\nMultiply: \\\\(3 \\\\times 121 = 363\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 363 = 364\\\\)\\n\\nSo, that simplifies to 364. Replacing that, the next layer is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 364\\\\). Let's compute this.\\n\\n6. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 364\\\\):\\n\\nMultiply: \\\\(3 \\\\times 364 = 1092\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\)\\n\\nGot it, 1093. Moving outward, the next expression is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 1093\\\\). Let me compute that.\\n\\n7. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 1093\\\\):\\n\\nMultiply: \\\\(3 \\\\times 1093 = 3279\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\)\\n\\nOkay, so that's 3280. Next layer is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3280\\\\). Let's do that.\\n\\n8. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3280\\\\):\\n\\nMultiply: \\\\(3 \\\\times 3280 = 9840\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\)\\n\\nAlright, 9841. Moving out another layer, the next expression is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 9841\\\\). Let me calculate that.\\n\\n9. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 9841\\\\):\\n\\nMultiply: \\\\(3 \\\\times 9841 = 29523\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 29523 = 29524\\\\)\\n\\nSo, that gives me 29524. Now, moving out to the next layer, which is \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 29524\\\\). Let me compute this.\\n\\n10. Compute \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 29524\\\\):\\n\\nMultiply: \\\\(3 \\\\times 29524 = 88572\\\\)\\n\\nAdd 1: \\\\(1 + 88572 = 88573\\\\)\\n\\nAlright, so that's 88573.

It's easy to make an arithmetic mistake when dealing with large numbers.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n2. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n3. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n4. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n5. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n6. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n7. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n8. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n9. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n10. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\n11. \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\\\\) \\u2013 correct.\\n\\nOkay, each step seems to check out.

Let me adjust the formula accordingly.\\n\\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution is \\\\(E_n^{(h)} = C \\\\times 3^n\\\\), and the particular solution can be found for the constant term.\\n\\nLet me set up the equation \\\\(E_n = 3E_{n-1} + 1\\\\).

      "    \"rollout\": \"Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and at first glance, it looks pretty intimidating. It's a nested expression with a bunch of parentheses, and I need to compute it step by step. Let me write it down to get a better look:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses! It seems like each level is multiplying by 3 and adding 1 inside the parentheses. I think the key here is to work from the innermost parentheses outward, like peeling an onion. That way, I can simplify the expression step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part. The innermost parentheses are at the very end: (1 + 3). Okay, so let's compute that first.\\n\\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4.\\n\\nNow, replacing that in the expression, the next layer out would be 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that down:\\n\\n1 + 3(4). Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me check the original expression again.\\n\\nYes, each layer is 3 multiplied by the next layer plus 1. So, actually, it's 3 times (1 + the next layer). So, the next step after simplifying the innermost parentheses is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that.\\n\\nFirst, 3 times 4 is 12. Then, adding 1 gives 13. So, now the expression becomes:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(13))\\n\\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I'm following the structure correctly. The original expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, each 3 is multiplied by the next set of parentheses, which contains 1 plus another 3 times another set of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nWait, hold on, that seems too big. Let me double-check. Maybe I'm not counting the layers correctly.\\n\\nWait, actually, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. So, starting from the innermost:\\n\\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nWait, that's growing really quickly. Let me see how many layers there are.\\n\\nLet me count the number of parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. (1 + 3) \\u2013 layer 1\\n2. (1 + 3(layer1)) \\u2013 layer 2\\n3. (1 + 3(layer2)) \\u2013 layer 3\\n4. (1 + 3(layer3)) \\u2013 layer 4\\n5. (1 + 3(layer4)) \\u2013 layer 5\\n6. (1 + 3(layer5)) \\u2013 layer 6\\n7. (1 + 3(layer6)) \\u2013 layer 7\\n8. (1 + 3(layer7)) \\u2013 layer 8\\n9. (1 + 3(layer8)) \\u2013 layer 9\\n10. (1 + 3(layer9)) \\u2013 layer 10\\n\\nSo, there are 10 layers in total. That means I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from layer 1 up to layer 10.\\n\\nLet me create a table to keep track:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\n\\nWait, so layer 10 is 88,573. But hold on, the original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire thing. Let me check.\\n\\nWait, no. Let me go back to the original problem:\\n\\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, it's 3 times the big expression. So, after computing the innermost 10 layers, which give me 88,573, I need to multiply that by 3.\\n\\nWait, no, hold on. Let me see: each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after layer 10, which is 88,573, is that the total inside the parentheses?

Problem: Compute\\n\\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ Solution: \\n<think>\\nAlright, so I've got this math problem here, and at first glance, it looks pretty intimidating. It's a nested expression with a bunch of parentheses, and I need to compute it step by step. Let me write it down to get a better look:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses! It seems like each level is multiplying by 3 and adding 1 inside the parentheses. I think the key here is to work from the innermost parentheses outward, like peeling an onion. That way, I can simplify the expression step by step.\\n\\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part. The innermost parentheses are at the very end: (1 + 3). Okay, so let's compute that first.\\n\\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4.\\n\\nNow, replacing that in the expression, the next layer out would be 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that down:\\n\\n1 + 3(4). Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me check the original expression again.\\n\\nYes, each layer is 3 multiplied by the next layer plus 1. So, actually, it's 3 times (1 + the next layer). So, the next step after simplifying the innermost parentheses is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that.\\n\\nFirst, 3 times 4 is 12. Then, adding 1 gives 13. So, now the expression becomes:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(13))\\n\\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I'm following the structure correctly. The original expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, each 3 is multiplied by the next set of parentheses, which contains 1 plus another 3 times another set of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nWait, hold on, that seems too big. Let me double-check. Maybe I'm not counting the layers correctly.\\n\\nWait, actually, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. So, starting from the innermost:\\n\\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nWait, that's growing really quickly. Let me see how many layers there are.\\n\\nLet me count the number of parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. (1 + 3) \\u2013 layer 1\\n2. (1 + 3(layer1)) \\u2013 layer 2\\n3. (1 + 3(layer2)) \\u2013 layer 3\\n4. (1 + 3(layer3)) \\u2013 layer 4\\n5. (1 + 3(layer4)) \\u2013 layer 5\\n6. (1 + 3(layer5)) \\u2013 layer 6\\n7. (1 + 3(layer6)) \\u2013 layer 7\\n8.

That means I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from layer 1 up to layer 10.\\n\\nLet me create a table to keep track:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\n\\nWait, so layer 10 is 88,573.

Let me go back to the original problem:\\n\\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, it's 3 times the big expression. So, after computing the innermost 10 layers, which give me 88,573, I need to multiply that by 3.\\n\\nWait, no, hold on. Let me see: each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after layer 10, which is 88,573, is that the total inside the parentheses? So, then the entire expression is 3*(88,573).\\n\\nLet me compute that.\\n\\n3 * 88,573.\\n\\nHmm, 3 times 80,000 is 240,000.\\n\\n3 times 8,573 is 25,719.\\n\\nSo, 240,000 + 25,719 = 265,719.\\n\\nWait, so is the final result 265,719?\\n\\nWait, let me verify that.

So, actually, the structure is:\\n\\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...*(1 + 3*1)...)))\\n\\nSo, the innermost is Layer 1: \\\\(1 + 3\\\\), then Layer 2 is \\\\(1 + 3*(Layer 1)\\\\), and so on, until Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, actually, I have 9 layers inside, and then multiplied by 3.\\n\\nWait, let me recount:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 2: \\\\(1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 3: \\\\(1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 4: \\\\(1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 5: \\\\(1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 6: \\\\(1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 7: \\\\(1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 8: \\\\(1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\\\)\\n\\nLayer 9: \\\\(1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\\\)\\n\\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524\\n\\nWait, 29,524 multiplied by 3. Let me compute that:\\n\\n29,524 * 3:\\n\\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\\n\\nThen, 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\\n\\n524 * 3 = 1,572\\n\\nSo, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572\\n\\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\\n\\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me verify each step because that seems a bit high, but considering the nesting, maybe it is correct.\\n\\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n\\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\\n\\nWait, so that seems consistent. Let me check Layer 9 again. 3 times 9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Then, 3 times that is 88,572. Yeah, that seems right.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers.\\n\\nLooking at the layers:\\n\\nLayer 1: 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1,093\\n\\nLayer 7: 3,280\\n\\nLayer 8: 9,841\\n\\nLayer 9: 29,524\\n\\nHmm, each term seems to be increasing by a factor of roughly 3 each time, but not exactly. Let me see the ratio between consecutive terms:\\n\\nLayer 2 / Layer 1: 13 / 4 = 3.25\\n\\nLayer 3 / Layer 2: 40 / 13 \\u2248 3.077\\n\\nLayer 4 / Layer 3: 121 / 40 = 3.025\\n\\nLayer 5 / Layer 4: 364 / 121 \\u2248 3.008\\n\\nLayer 6 / Layer 5: 1,093 / 364 \\u2248 3.003\\n\\nLayer 7 / Layer 6: 3,280 / 1,093 \\u2248 2.998\\n\\nLayer 8 / Layer 7: 9,841 / 3,280 \\u2248 3.003\\n\\nLayer 9 / Layer 8: 29,524 / 9,841 \\u2248 3.001\\n\\nSo, as we go deeper, the ratio approaches 3, which makes sense because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, as the previous layer gets large, the 1 becomes negligible, and each new layer is approximately 3 times the previous one.\\n\\nBut for exact computation, we have to include the 1 each time, so the ratio approaches 3 from below as we go deeper.\\n\\nBut anyway, since we've computed each layer step by step, and the final result is 88,572, I think that's the answer.\\n\\nWait, let me just confirm the very first step.

But maybe there's a pattern here that I can exploit. Let me see... Each time, it seems like there's a 3 multiplied by something, and inside that something, there's another similar expression. It almost looks recursive or something.\\n\\nHmm, maybe if I work from the inside out, it will make more sense. That usually helps with parentheses. So, let's try that. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part:\\n\\n1. The innermost expression is \\\\(1 + 3\\\\).\\n2. Then, moving one layer out, it's \\\\(1 + 3(\\\\text{previous result})\\\\).\\n3.

Okay, so first, I need to understand the structure of this expression. It seems like it's a series of nested multiplications and additions. Let me try to break it down from the innermost part.\\n\\nStarting from the inside, the innermost part is:\\n\\n$1 + 3$\\n\\nSo, let's compute that first. That would be 1 + 3, which equals 4. Okay, so replacing that, the next layer would be:\\n\\n$1 + 3 \\\\times 4$\\n\\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The expression is a series of 1 + 3 multiplied by another set of parentheses. So, each time, it's 1 + 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3 times that result.\\n\\nSo, let me try to write this down step by step.\\n\\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3 \\u00d7 (Layer 1) = 1 + 3 \\u00d7 4\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3 \\u00d7 (Layer 2)\\n\\nAnd so on, until Layer 9: 1 + 3 \\u00d7 (Layer 8)\\n\\nWait, let me count how many layers there are. Let's see, each \\\"1+3(...)\\\" is a layer. The innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9 because there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9.\\n\\nOkay, so starting with Layer 1:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3 \\u00d7 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3 \\u00d7 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3 \\u00d7 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3 \\u00d7 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3 \\u00d7 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3 \\u00d7 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3 \\u00d7 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 \\u00d7 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nSo, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. That seems to be the pattern.\\n\\nLet me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \\u2013 correct.\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\u2013 correct.\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\u2013 correct.\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\u2013 correct.\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\u2013 correct.\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\u2013 correct.\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\u2013 correct.\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\u2013 correct.\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\u2013 correct.\\n\\nSo, all layers computed correctly. Therefore, the final result is 29524.\\n\\nWait, but let me check if I interpreted the expression correctly. The original problem is:\\n\\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\\n\\nSo, it starts with a 3 multiplied by the entire expression inside the parentheses. So, the entire expression is:\\n\\n3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )) with nine layers.\\n\\nWait a second, in my previous computation, I considered the innermost expression as Layer 1, which is correct because it's 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, I think I did it correctly.\\n\\nBut just to be thorough, let me parse the expression again.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\\n\\nContinuing this way, each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result.\\n\\nSince there are nine layers, starting from 1 + 3, so the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2, ..., up to Layer 9.\\n\\nWait, let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\\n\\nLooking at the original expression:\\n\\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \\\"1+3(\\\" is a new layer. Starting from the first one after 3, so:\\n\\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, how many \\\"1+3(\\\" are there? Let's see:\\n\\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nEach \\\"1+3(\\\" is followed by another set, so starting from the innermost, each set is one layer.\\n\\nCounting the number of \\\"1+3(\\\" after the initial 3:\\n\\n1. 1+3(\\n2. 1+3(\\n3. 1+3(\\n4. 1+3(\\n5. 1+3(\\n6. 1+3(\\n7. 1+3(\\n8. 1+3(\\n9. 1+3(\\n10. ).......\\n\\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\\n\\nStarting after the first 3, the expression is:\\n\\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, each \\\"1+3(\\\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\\n\\n1. 1+3(\\n2. 1+3(\\n3. 1+3(\\n4. 1+3(\\n5. 1+3(\\n6. 1+3(\\n7. 1+3(\\n8. 1+3(\\n9. 1+3(\\n\\nSo, there are 9 \\\"1+3(\\\" after the initial 3. Therefore, the innermost layer is Layer 9, and each subsequent layer is one layer out.\\n\\nWait, now I'm confused. Previously, I considered Layer 1 as the innermost, but now it seems that the innermost is Layer 9.\\n\\nWait, no, that can't be. Let me clarify.\\n\\nThe expression is:\\n\\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, and then each layer wraps around it.\\n\\nSo, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4\\n\\nThen, Layer 2: 1+3*4=13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\\n\\nLayer 4:1+3*40=121\\n\\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\\n\\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\\n\\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\\n\\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\\n\\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572\\n\\nWait, hold on! Wait, in my initial calculation, I considered only the innermost expression as 1+3, and then each layer is 1+3 times the previous. But in reality, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the end.\\n\\nSo, perhaps I misunderstood the structure.\\n\\nLet me parse the expression again.\\n\\nThe entire expression is 3 multiplied by a nested expression.\\n\\nSo, the structure is:\\n\\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, it's 3 times a series of 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3=4, then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous.\\n\\nSo, starting with Layer 1: 1+3=4\\n\\nLayer 2:1+3*4=13\\n\\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\\n\\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\\n\\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\\n\\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\\n\\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\\n\\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\\n\\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * Layer9 = 3*29524=88572\\n\\nWait, so previously I thought that the final result was 29524, but actually, that was just the innermost expression after 9 layers, but the entire problem is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572.\\n\\nSo, I think I made a mistake earlier by not multiplying the final result by 3.\\n\\nLet me clarify.\\n\\nThe expression is:\\n\\n3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, it's 3 multiplied by a nested expression with 9 layers of 1+3(...).\\n\\nTherefore, the innermost is Layer1:1+3=4\\n\\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\\n\\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\\n\\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\\n\\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\\n\\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\\n\\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\\n\\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\\n\\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\\n\\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me verify this because earlier I thought the entire expression was just the 29524, but that's only the innermost after 9 layers, but in reality, the 3 is multiplied at the end.\\n\\nSo, yes, I need to multiply the result of the innermost 9 layers by 3.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\\n\\nBut to make sure, let me compute it step by step again, including the multiplication by 3 at the end.\\n\\nLayer1:1+3=4\\n\\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\\n\\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\\n\\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\\n\\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\\n\\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\\n\\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\\n\\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\\n\\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\\n\\nThen, multiply by 3:29524*3=88572\\n\\nYes, that seems correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small table to compute each layer.\\n\\nLet me do that.\\n\\nLayer | Calculation | Result\\n-----|-------------|-------\\n1    | 1 + 3       | 4\\n2    | 1 + 3*4     | 13\\n3    | 1 + 3*13    | 40\\n4    | 1 + 3*40    | 121\\n5    | 1 + 3*121   | 364\\n6    | 1 + 3*364   | 1093\\n7    | 1 + 3*1093  | 3280\\n8    | 1 + 3*3280  | 9841\\n9    | 1 + 3*9841  | 29524\\n10   | 3*29524     | 88572\\n\\nSo, Layer 10 is the final result after computing Layer9 and then multiplying by 3.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\\n\\nJust to double-check, let me compute Layer9 again:\\n\\nLayer9:1 + 3*9841\\n\\nCompute 3*9841:\\n\\n9841 * 3: Let's compute 10,000*3=30,000, minus (159*3)=477, so 30,000 - 477=29,523.\\n\\nThen, Layer9:1 + 29,523=29,524.\\n\\nThen, 29,524*3:\\n\\n29,524*3: 29,000*3=87,000; 524*3=1,572; so total 87,000 +1,572=88,572.\\n\\nYes, that matches.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nI think that's the correct answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of the expression is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way out.

Therefore, the final result is 29524.\\n\\nWait, but let me check if I interpreted the expression correctly. The original problem is:\\n\\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\\n\\nSo, it starts with a 3 multiplied by the entire expression inside the parentheses. So, the entire expression is:\\n\\n3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )) with nine layers.\\n\\nWait a second, in my previous computation, I considered the innermost expression as Layer 1, which is correct because it's 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, I think I did it correctly.\\n\\nBut just to be thorough, let me parse the expression again.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\\n\\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\\n\\nContinuing this way, each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result.\\n\\nSince there are nine layers, starting from 1 + 3, so the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2, ..., up to Layer 9.\\n\\nWait, let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\\n\\nLooking at the original expression:\\n\\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \\\"1+3(\\\" is a new layer. Starting from the first one after 3, so:\\n\\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, how many \\\"1+3(\\\" are there? Let's see:\\n\\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nEach \\\"1+3(\\\" is followed by another set, so starting from the innermost, each set is one layer.\\n\\nCounting the number of \\\"1+3(\\\" after the initial 3:\\n\\n1. 1+3(\\n2. 1+3(\\n3. 1+3(\\n4. 1+3(\\n5. 1+3(\\n6. 1+3(\\n7. 1+3(\\n8. 1+3(\\n9. 1+3(\\n10. ).......\\n\\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\\n\\nStarting after the first 3, the expression is:\\n\\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, each \\\"1+3(\\\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\\n\\n1. 1+3(\\n2. 1+3(\\n3. 1+3(\\n4. 1+3(\\n5. 1+3(\\n6. 1+3(\\n7. 1+3(\\n8. 1+3(\\n9. 1+3(\\n\\nSo, there are 9 \\\"1+3(\\\" after the initial 3. Therefore, the innermost layer is Layer 9, and each subsequent layer is one layer out.\\n\\nWait, now I'm confused. Previously, I considered Layer 1 as the innermost, but now it seems that the innermost is Layer 9.\\n\\nWait, no, that can't be. Let me clarify.\\n\\nThe expression is:\\n\\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, and then each layer wraps around it.\\n\\nSo, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4\\n\\nThen, Layer 2: 1+3*4=13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\\n\\nLayer 4:1+3*40=121\\n\\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\\n\\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\\n\\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\\n\\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\\n\\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572\\n\\nWait, hold on! Wait, in my initial calculation, I considered only the innermost expression as 1+3, and then each layer is 1+3 times the previous. But in reality, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the end.\\n\\nSo, perhaps I misunderstood the structure.\\n\\nLet me parse the expression again.\\n\\nThe entire expression is 3 multiplied by a nested expression.\\n\\nSo, the structure is:\\n\\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, it's 3 times a series of 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3=4, then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous.\\n\\nSo, starting with Layer 1: 1+3=4\\n\\nLayer 2:1+3*4=13\\n\\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\\n\\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\\n\\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\\n\\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\\n\\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\\n\\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\\n\\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * Layer9 = 3*29524=88572\\n\\nWait, so previously I thought that the final result was 29524, but actually, that was just the innermost expression after 9 layers, but the entire problem is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572.\\n\\nSo, I think I made a mistake earlier by not multiplying the final result by 3.\\n\\nLet me clarify.\\n\\nThe expression is:\\n\\n3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\\n\\nSo, it's 3 multiplied by a nested expression with 9 layers of 1+3(...).\\n\\nTherefore, the innermost is Layer1:1+3=4\\n\\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\\n\\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\\n\\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\\n\\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\\n\\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\\n\\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\\n\\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\\n\\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\\n\\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\\n\\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, but let me verify this because earlier I thought the entire expression was just the 29524, but that's only the innermost after 9 layers, but in reality, the 3 is multiplied at the end.\\n\\nSo, yes, I need to multiply the result of the innermost 9 layers by 3.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\\n\\nBut to make sure, let me compute it step by step again, including the multiplication by 3 at the end.\\n\\nLayer1:1+3=4\\n\\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\\n\\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\\n\\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\\n\\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\\n\\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\\n\\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\\n\\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\\n\\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\\n\\nThen, multiply by 3:29524*3=88572\\n\\nYes, that seems correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small table to compute each layer.\\n\\nLet me do that.\\n\\nLayer | Calculation | Result\\n-----|-------------|-------\\n1    | 1 + 3       | 4\\n2    | 1 + 3*4     | 13\\n3    | 1 + 3*13    | 40\\n4    | 1 + 3*40    | 121\\n5    | 1 + 3*121   | 364\\n6    | 1 + 3*364   | 1093\\n7    | 1 + 3*1093  | 3280\\n8    | 1 + 3*3280  | 9841\\n9    | 1 + 3*9841  | 29524\\n10   | 3*29524     | 88572\\n\\nSo, Layer 10 is the final result after computing Layer9 and then multiplying by 3.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\\n\\nJust to double-check, let me compute Layer9 again:\\n\\nLayer9:1 + 3*9841\\n\\nCompute 3*9841:\\n\\n9841 * 3: Let's compute 10,000*3=30,000, minus (159*3)=477, so 30,000 - 477=29,523.\\n\\nThen, Layer9:1 + 29,523=29,524.\\n\\nThen, 29,524*3:\\n\\n29,524*3: 29,000*3=87,000; 524*3=1,572; so total 87,000 +1,572=88,572.\\n\\nYes, that matches.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nI think that's the correct answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of the expression is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way out. The expression is:\\n\\n\\\\[ 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\\\]\\n\\nWe denote each layer starting from the innermost part:\\n\\n1. Layer 1: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n2. Layer 2: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n3. Layer 3: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\\\)\\n4. Layer 4: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\\\)\\n5.

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions like this.\\n\\nSo, the innermost part is at the very end: 1 + 3.

But okay, let's take it one step at a time. I remember that when solving expressions with parentheses, you should start from the innermost set and work your way out. So, I'll need to compute the innermost part first and then substitute it back into the expression, repeating this process until I can't do it anymore.\\n\\nLet me number the expressions to keep track better. Starting from the inside:\\n\\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\\n\\nSo, 1 + 3 equals 4. That wasn't too bad. Let me replace that part in the expression. So now, the next layer out would be:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(...)) becomes 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). But since I just computed the innermost (1 + 3) as 4, the next layer would be:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(4)). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Yes, because the next set of parentheses is 1 + 3(...), and the ... was 4, so it's 1 + 3*4.\\n\\nWait, hold on. Is it 1 + 3*(4) or is it (1 + 3)*4? Hmm, no, because in the original expression, it's 3(1 + 3(...)). So the 3 multiplies the entire (1 + 3(...)). So when I replace the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, it becomes 3(1 + 3*4). Hmm, that's a bit different.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should parenthesize it properly to avoid confusion. Let me see:\\n\\nOriginal expression:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) )\\n\\nLet me replace the innermost (1 + 3) with 4:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) )\\n\\nNow, the next innermost is 1 + 3(...).

Let me check the layers again because I think I might have miscounted. Let me write out each step clearly.\\n\\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\\n\\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\\n\\n2. Move one layer out: (1 + 3*(result from step 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. Next: (1 + 3*(result from step 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. Then: (1 + 3*(result from step 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. Next: (1 + 3*(result from step 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\n7. Then: (1 + 3*(result from step 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\n8. Next: (1 + 3*(result from step 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\n9.

Finally, the outermost operation: 3*(result from step 10) = 3*88573 = 265719\\n\\nSo, according to this, the value of the entire expression is 265719.\\n\\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\\n\\nStarting from step 1:\\n\\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \\u2705\\n\\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\u2705\\n\\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\u2705\\n\\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\u2705\\n\\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\u2705\\n\\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\u2705\\n\\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\u2705\\n\\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\u2705\\n\\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\u2705\\n\\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 \\u2705\\n\\n11. 3*88573 = 265719 \\u2705\\n\\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each step follows from the previous one, and I don't see any calculation errors.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to verify. Perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\\n\\nLooking at the structure, it's a series of nested 1 + 3(...) expressions, each multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3. This seems like a geometric progression or something similar.\\n\\nLet me think about it as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as L_n where n is the number of layers from the innermost.\\n\\nSo, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nL_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\nL_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n\\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n\\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n\\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\\n\\nL_10 = 1 + 3*L_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\\n\\nThen, the final step is 3*L_10 = 3*88573 = 265719\\n\\nSo, this method also gives the same result. That's reassuring.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a general formula for L_n.\\n\\nLooking at the recurrence relation:\\n\\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\\n\\nThis is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence is of the form:\\n\\nL_n = A*3^n + B\\n\\nWhere A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition.\\n\\nWhen n=1, L_1=4.\\n\\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B\\n\\nWhen n=2, L_2=13.\\n\\n13 = A*3^2 + B => 13 = 9A + B\\n\\nNow, we have the system of equations:\\n\\n3A + B = 4\\n\\n9A + B = 13\\n\\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\\n\\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\\n\\n6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2\\n\\nThen, plugging back A=3/2 into 3A + B =4:\\n\\n3*(3/2) + B =4 => 9/2 + B =4 => B =4 - 9/2 = -1/2\\n\\nSo, the general formula is:\\n\\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\nL_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\\n\\nSo, for n=10, which is our case, L_{10} = (3^{11} -1)/2\\n\\nCompute 3^{11}:\\n\\n3^1 =3\\n\\n3^2=9\\n\\n3^3=27\\n\\n3^4=81\\n\\n3^5=243\\n\\n3^6=729\\n\\n3^7=2187\\n\\n3^8=6561\\n\\n3^9=19683\\n\\n3^10=59049\\n\\n3^11=177147\\n\\nSo, L_{10} = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573\\n\\nWhich matches our earlier result. Then, 3*L_{10} = 3*88573=265719\\n\\nSo, this formula method also confirms the result.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern in the numbers we're getting.\\n\\nLooking at the L_n sequence:\\n\\nn: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10\\n\\nL_n:4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524,88573\\n\\nLooking at these numbers, they seem to be growing exponentially, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\\n\\nI notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term, plus 1. So, it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but with a constant added each time.\\n\\nThis is similar to a geometric series, but in this case, it's a linear recurrence.\\n\\nAnother way to think about it is that each L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we derived earlier.\\n\\nSo, for n=10, L_{10}=(3^{11}-1)/2=(177147-1)/2=177146/2=88573\\n\\nThen, the final answer is 3*88573=265719\\n\\nI think I've verified this in multiple ways: step-by-step computation, using a recurrence relation with a formula, and checking the pattern. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 265719 is the correct answer.\\n\\nJust to make sure, let me compute one more layer manually.\\n\\nStarting from L_10=88573\\n\\nThen L_11=1 +3*88573=1 +265719=265720\\n\\nBut wait, in our original problem, the outermost operation is 3*(...), so it's 3*L_10=265719\\n\\nYes, that matches.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I compute L_11, it's 265720, but our problem stops at 3*(L_10), which is 265719.\\n\\nSo, all right, that seems consistent.\\n\\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and multiple methods confirm the result.

Problem: Compute\\n\\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ Solution: \\n<think>\\nAlright, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. It looks kind of complicated with all these nested parentheses, but I think I can handle it step by step. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses! But okay, let's take it one step at a time. I remember that when solving expressions with parentheses, you should start from the innermost set and work your way out. So, I'll need to compute the innermost part first and then substitute it back into the expression, repeating this process until I can't do it anymore.\\n\\nLet me number the expressions to keep track better. Starting from the inside:\\n\\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\\n\\nSo, 1 + 3 equals 4. That wasn't too bad. Let me replace that part in the expression. So now, the next layer out would be:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(...)) becomes 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). But since I just computed the innermost (1 + 3) as 4, the next layer would be:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(4)). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Yes, because the next set of parentheses is 1 + 3(...), and the ... was 4, so it's 1 + 3*4.\\n\\nWait, hold on. Is it 1 + 3*(4) or is it (1 + 3)*4? Hmm, no, because in the original expression, it's 3(1 + 3(...)). So the 3 multiplies the entire (1 + 3(...)). So when I replace the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, it becomes 3(1 + 3*4). Hmm, that's a bit different.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should parenthesize it properly to avoid confusion. Let me see:\\n\\nOriginal expression:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) )\\n\\nLet me replace the innermost (1 + 3) with 4:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) )\\n\\nNow, the next innermost is 1 + 3(...). Let's compute that. But wait, it's inside another 3(...). Let me clarify.\\n\\nWait, maybe I should work from the inside out, layer by layer. Let me try that.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: (1 + 3(Layer1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: (1 + 3(Layer2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: (1 + 3(Layer3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: (1 + 3(Layer4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: (1 + 3(Layer5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nLayer 7: (1 + 3(Layer6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nLayer 8: (1 + 3(Layer7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nLayer 9: (1 + 3(Layer8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nLayer 10: (1 + 3(Layer9)) = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\n\\nLayer 11: 3*(Layer10) = 3*88573 = 265719\\n\\nWait, but hold on. Let me check the layers again because I think I might have miscounted. Let me write out each step clearly.\\n\\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\\n\\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\\n\\n2. Move one layer out: (1 + 3*(result from step 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. Next: (1 + 3*(result from step 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. Then: (1 + 3*(result from step 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. Next: (1 + 3*(result from step 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\n7. Then: (1 + 3*(result from step 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\n8. Next: (1 + 3*(result from step 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\n9. Then: (1 + 3*(result from step 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\n10. Next: (1 + 3*(result from step 9)) = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\n\\n11. Finally, the outermost operation: 3*(result from step 10) = 3*88573 = 265719\\n\\nSo, according to this, the value of the entire expression is 265719.\\n\\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\\n\\nStarting from step 1:\\n\\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \\u2705\\n\\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\u2705\\n\\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\u2705\\n\\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\u2705\\n\\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\u2705\\n\\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\u2705\\n\\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\u2705\\n\\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\u2705\\n\\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\u2705\\n\\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 \\u2705\\n\\n11. 3*88573 = 265719 \\u2705\\n\\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each step follows from the previous one, and I don't see any calculation errors.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to verify. Perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\\n\\nLooking at the structure, it's a series of nested 1 + 3(...) expressions, each multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3. This seems like a geometric progression or something similar.\\n\\nLet me think about it as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as L_n where n is the number of layers from the innermost.\\n\\nSo, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nL_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\nL_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\\n\\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\\n\\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\\n\\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\\n\\nL_10 = 1 + 3*L_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\\n\\nThen, the final step is 3*L_10 = 3*88573 = 265719\\n\\nSo, this method also gives the same result. That's reassuring.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a general formula for L_n.\\n\\nLooking at the recurrence relation:\\n\\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\\n\\nThis is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence is of the form:\\n\\nL_n = A*3^n + B\\n\\nWhere A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition.\\n\\nWhen n=1, L_1=4.\\n\\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B\\n\\nWhen n=2, L_2=13.\\n\\n13 = A*3^2 + B => 13 = 9A + B\\n\\nNow, we have the system of equations:\\n\\n3A + B = 4\\n\\n9A + B = 13\\n\\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\\n\\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\\n\\n6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2\\n\\nThen, plugging back A=3/2 into 3A + B =4:\\n\\n3*(3/2) + B =4 => 9/2 + B =4 => B =4 - 9/2 = -1/2\\n\\nSo, the general formula is:\\n\\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\nL_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\\n\\nSo, for n=10, which is our case, L_{10} = (3^{11} -1)/2\\n\\nCompute 3^{11}:\\n\\n3^1 =3\\n\\n3^2=9\\n\\n3^3=27\\n\\n3^4=81\\n\\n3^5=243\\n\\n3^6=729\\n\\n3^7=2187\\n\\n3^8=6561\\n\\n3^9=19683\\n\\n3^10=59049\\n\\n3^11=177147\\n\\nSo, L_{10} = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573\\n\\nWhich matches our earlier result. Then, 3*L_{10} = 3*88573=265719\\n\\nSo, this formula method also confirms the result.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern in the numbers we're getting.\\n\\nLooking at the L_n sequence:\\n\\nn: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10\\n\\nL_n:4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524,88573\\n\\nLooking at these numbers, they seem to be growing exponentially, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\\n\\nI notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term, plus 1.

I guess the key here is to work from the innermost set of parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these nested problems.\\n\\nLet me start by numbering the parentheses to keep track of them better. I'll label each set starting from the innermost one as level 1, then level 2, and so on until I get to the outermost one. So, let's see:\\n\\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\\n2. Next: (1 + 3(...))\\n3.

So, I need to compute each level step by step.\\n\\nStarting with Level 1:\\n\\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\\n\\nOkay, moving on to Level 2:\\n\\nLevel 2: (1 + 3(Level 1 result)) = 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nWait, hold on.

Maybe there's a pattern here?\\n\\nLevel 5:\\n\\nLevel 5: 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nHmm, 364. Doesn't seem like a perfect square, but let me keep going.\\n\\nLevel 6:\\n\\nLevel 6: 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nOkay, 1093. Not sure if that's significant.

Hmm, that's a four-digit number. Maybe it's a square? Let me check. What's the square root of 9841? Let's see, 99 squared is 9801, and 100 squared is 10000. So, 99^2 = 9801, 99*99 = 9801, so 9841 is 9801 + 40, which is 99^2 + 40. Not a perfect square. Okay.\\n\\nLevel 9:\\n\\nLevel 9: 3(1 + 3(Level 8 result)) = 3(1 + 3(9841)) = 3(1 + 29523) = 3(29524) = 88572\\n\\nWait, hold on. Is that right? Let me double-check.\\n\\nSo, Level 8 is 9841. Then Level 9 is 3*(1 + 3*9841). So, 3*(1 + 29523). 1 + 29523 is 29524. Then 3*29524.\\n\\nLet me compute 3*29524:\\n\\n29524 * 3:\\n\\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\\n\\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\\n\\n500 * 3 = 1,500\\n\\n24 * 3 = 72\\n\\nSo, adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\\n\\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\\n\\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\\n\\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nWait, that seems quite large, but given that each level is tripling the previous result plus 1, it makes sense that it's growing exponentially.

So, the final result is 88,572.\\n\\nI wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without having to go through each level step by step. Let me think.\\n\\nEach level can be represented recursively. Let's denote a_n as the result at level n. Then,\\n\\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2\\n\\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me write that down:\\n\\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\\n\\nWith a_1 = 4\\n\\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and finding a particular solution.\\n\\nThe homogeneous recurrence is:\\n\\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\\n\\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\\n\\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\\n\\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution. Let\\u2019s assume a particular solution is a constant C.\\n\\nPlugging into the recurrence:\\n\\nC = 3*C + 1\\n\\nC - 3*C = 1\\n\\n-2C = 1\\n\\nC = -1/2\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is:\\n\\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\\n\\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\\n\\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\\n\\n4 = 3A - 1/2\\n\\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\\n\\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\\n\\n4.5 = 3A\\n\\nA = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is:\\n\\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\n\\nSo, for n = 9:\\n\\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\\n\\nCompute 3^10:\\n\\n3^1 = 3\\n\\n3^2 = 9\\n\\n3^3 = 27\\n\\n3^4 = 81\\n\\n3^5 = 243\\n\\n3^6 = 729\\n\\n3^7 = 2187\\n\\n3^8 = 6561\\n\\n3^9 = 19,683\\n\\n3^10 = 59,049\\n\\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524\\n\\nWait, but earlier, I got Level 9 as 88,572, which is 3*(1 + 3*9841) = 88,572. But according to this formula, a_9 = 29,524.\\n\\nHmm, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake in the general solution?\\n\\nWait, let me double-check the recurrence.\\n\\nWait, actually, in my initial setup, I considered a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\\n\\nBut in the problem, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 3*...), which would correspond to a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*a_8). But in my general solution, I considered a_n as the innermost expression, so maybe I need to adjust the indexing.\\n\\nLet me think again.\\n\\nActually, the problem is structured as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, starting from the innermost, each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, the recurrence is correct: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\\n\\nBut according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524.\\n\\nWait, but earlier when I computed step by step, Level 9 was 88,572, which is 3*(1 + 3*9841) = 3*(1 + 29,523) = 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\\n\\nSo, the formula gives me a_9 = 29,524, which is the value before multiplying by 3 in the outermost operation.\\n\\nSo, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nSo, that makes sense. The general formula gives me a_9, which is the value at the 9th level without the outermost 3 multiplier. So, to get the final result, I need to multiply a_9 by 3.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*((3^{10} - 1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\\n\\nCompute 3^{11}:\\n\\n3^10 = 59,049\\n\\n3^11 = 177,147\\n\\nThus, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144 / 2 = 88,572.\\n\\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, using the recurrence relation, I can derive that the result is (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88,572.\\n\\nThis is a much faster way than computing each level step by step, especially if the problem were deeper. So, I think this method is more efficient and reduces the chance of calculation errors.\\n\\nBut since I already computed it step by step, and it's a manageable number of levels, both methods lead me to the same result: 88,572.\\n\\nJust to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes in the step-by-step approach:\\n\\nStarting from Level 1:\\n\\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\n9. Level 9: 3*(1 + 3*9841) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88,572\\n\\nYes, each step checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe computed value is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\\n\\n\\\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\]\\n\\nWe start by working from the innermost set of parentheses and move outwards.

Let\\u2019s assume a particular solution is a constant C.\\n\\nPlugging into the recurrence:\\n\\nC = 3*C + 1\\n\\nC - 3*C = 1\\n\\n-2C = 1\\n\\nC = -1/2\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is:\\n\\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\\n\\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\\n\\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\\n\\n4 = 3A - 1/2\\n\\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\\n\\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\\n\\n4.5 = 3A\\n\\nA = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is:\\n\\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\n\\nSo, for n = 9:\\n\\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\\n\\nCompute 3^10:\\n\\n3^1 = 3\\n\\n3^2 = 9\\n\\n3^3 = 27\\n\\n3^4 = 81\\n\\n3^5 = 243\\n\\n3^6 = 729\\n\\n3^7 = 2187\\n\\n3^8 = 6561\\n\\n3^9 = 19,683\\n\\n3^10 = 59,049\\n\\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524\\n\\nWait, but earlier, I got Level 9 as 88,572, which is 3*(1 + 3*9841) = 88,572. But according to this formula, a_9 = 29,524.\\n\\nHmm, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake in the general solution?\\n\\nWait, let me double-check the recurrence.\\n\\nWait, actually, in my initial setup, I considered a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\\n\\nBut in the problem, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 3*...), which would correspond to a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*a_8). But in my general solution, I considered a_n as the innermost expression, so maybe I need to adjust the indexing.\\n\\nLet me think again.\\n\\nActually, the problem is structured as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, starting from the innermost, each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, the recurrence is correct: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\\n\\nBut according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524.\\n\\nWait, but earlier when I computed step by step, Level 9 was 88,572, which is 3*(1 + 3*9841) = 3*(1 + 29,523) = 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\\n\\nSo, the formula gives me a_9 = 29,524, which is the value before multiplying by 3 in the outermost operation.\\n\\nSo, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nSo, that makes sense. The general formula gives me a_9, which is the value at the 9th level without the outermost 3 multiplier. So, to get the final result, I need to multiply a_9 by 3.\\n\\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*((3^{10} - 1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\\n\\nCompute 3^{11}:\\n\\n3^10 = 59,049\\n\\n3^11 = 177,147\\n\\nThus, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144 / 2 = 88,572.\\n\\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, using the recurrence relation, I can derive that the result is (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88,572.\\n\\nThis is a much faster way than computing each level step by step, especially if the problem were deeper. So, I think this method is more efficient and reduces the chance of calculation errors.\\n\\nBut since I already computed it step by step, and it's a manageable number of levels, both methods lead me to the same result: 88,572.\\n\\nJust to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes in the step-by-step approach:\\n\\nStarting from Level 1:\\n\\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\n9. Level 9: 3*(1 + 3*9841) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88,572\\n\\nYes, each step checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe computed value is \\\\boxed{88572}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\\n\\n\\\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\]\\n\\nWe start by working from the innermost set of parentheses and move outwards. We denote each level of computation as follows:\\n\\n1. Level 1: \\\\(1 + 3 = 4\\\\)\\n2. Level 2: \\\\(1 + 3 \\\\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\\\)\\n3.

Let me try to break it down.\\n\\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built using a repeating pattern: 3 times something, which is 1 plus 3 times another expression. So, it seems like a recursive or repetitive structure. Maybe I can find a pattern or a way to simplify it.\\n\\nLet me start from the innermost part and work my way out.

Next:\\n\\n1 + 3(364)\\n\\n3 times 364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093.\\n\\nHmm, that's getting big. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. So far, starting from the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\n1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\n1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\n1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\n1 + 3*364 = 1,093\\n\\nWait a second, these numbers look familiar. 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1,093... These are like tetrahedral numbers or something? Or maybe related to powers of 4?\\n\\nWait, let me think. 4 is 3 + 1, 13 is 9 + 4, 40 is 27 + 13, 121 is 64 + 57? Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's better to see how each step is related to the previous.\\n\\nLooking at the first few steps:\\n\\nStarting with 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nThen 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nThen 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nThen 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nThen 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\nThen 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\\n\\nSo each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result).

Hmm, so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's level 1, and each time we go out, it's another level. So, the innermost is level 1, then level 2, up to level 10.\\n\\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I only went up to a_6, which is 1,093. So, does that mean I need to compute up to a_10?\\n\\nWait, let me make sure. The original expression has 9 \\\"3(\\\" after the initial 3. So, it's 10 levels deep.

Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524? Wait, hold on, 3*9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Wait, did I do that right?\\n\\nWait, 9,841 * 3: 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 800 * 3 = 2,400; 40 * 3 = 120; 1 * 3 = 3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then add 1: 29,524. So, Level 9: 29,524.\\n\\nThen Level 10: 1 + 3*29,524 = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573.\\n\\nWait, now I get 88,573 instead of 88,570 earlier. So, I think I miscalculated Level 9 earlier. Let me double-check.\\n\\nLevel 8: 9,841\\n\\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9,841\\n\\nCompute 3*9,841:\\n\\n9,841 * 3:\\n\\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\\n\\n800 * 3 = 2,400 \\u2192 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\\n\\n40 * 3 = 120 \\u2192 29,400 + 120 = 29,520\\n\\n1 * 3 = 3 \\u2192 29,520 + 3 = 29,523\\n\\nSo, 3*9,841 = 29,523. Then add 1: 29,523 + 1 = 29,524. So, Level 9: 29,524.\\n\\nThen Level 10: 1 + 3*29,524.\\n\\nCompute 3*29,524:\\n\\n29,524 * 3:\\n\\n29,000 * 3 = 87,000\\n\\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \\u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\\n\\n24 * 3 = 72 \\u2192 88,500 + 72 = 88,572\\n\\nThen add 1: 88,572 + 1 = 88,573.\\n\\nSo, the final result is 88,573.\\n\\nBut wait, in my initial computation, I thought Level 10 was 88,570, but that was incorrect because I miscalculated Level 9 as 29,523 instead of 29,524.\\n\\nSo, the correct computation is 88,573.\\n\\nBut let me check another way to make sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression.\\n\\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\\n\\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\\n\\nThe recurrence is:\\n\\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\\n\\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\\n\\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\\n\\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\\n\\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\\n\\nK = 3*K + 1\\n\\nSolving for K:\\n\\nK - 3*K = 1 \\u2192 -2*K = 1 \\u2192 K = -1/2\\n\\nSo, the general solution is:\\n\\na_n = C*3^n - 1/2\\n\\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\\n\\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \\u2192 4 = 3*C - 1/2\\n\\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\\n\\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C \\u2192 9/2 = 3*C \\u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\\n\\nSo, the closed-form solution is:\\n\\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\n\\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\n\\nSo, for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\\n\\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\\n\\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches.\\n\\nOkay, so this formula seems correct.\\n\\nTherefore, for the original problem, which has 10 levels (n=10), the result is:\\n\\na_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2\\n\\nCompute 3^11:\\n\\n3^1 = 3\\n\\n3^2 = 9\\n\\n3^3 = 27\\n\\n3^4 = 81\\n\\n3^5 = 243\\n\\n3^6 = 729\\n\\n3^7 = 2,187\\n\\n3^8 = 6,561\\n\\n3^9 = 19,683\\n\\n3^10 = 59,049\\n\\n3^11 = 177,147\\n\\nSo, 3^11 = 177,147\\n\\nThen, a_10 = (177,147 - 1)/2 = 177,146 / 2 = 88,573\\n\\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\\n\\nTherefore, the result is 88,573.\\n\\nI think that's solid.

Let me denote each term as a_n where n is the number of times we do the operation.\\n\\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\\n\\nWait, so we're doing this six times? Let me count the number of 3(...) in the original expression.\\n\\nLooking back at the original problem:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nLet's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the left:\\n\\n1. 3(\\n2. 1 + 3(\\n3. 1 + 3(\\n4. 1 + 3(\\n5. 1 + 3(\\n6. 1 + 3(\\n7. 1 + 3(\\n8. 1 + 3(\\n9. 1 + 3(\\n10. 1 + 3\\n11. )\\n)\\n)\\n)\\n)\\n)\\n)\\n)\\n)\\n)\\n\\nWait, that's 10 levels deep? Hmm, so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's level 1, and each time we go out, it's another level. So, the innermost is level 1, then level 2, up to level 10.\\n\\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I only went up to a_6, which is 1,093. So, does that mean I need to compute up to a_10?\\n\\nWait, let me make sure. The original expression has 9 \\\"3(\\\" after the initial 3. So, it's 10 levels deep. So, starting from the innermost:\\n\\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\\n\\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\\n\\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\\n\\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,523\\n\\nLevel 10: 1 + 3*29,523 = 88,570\\n\\nWait, so if we go all the way up to level 10, the final result is 88,570.\\n\\nBut hold on, let me verify this step by step because that seems like a big number. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.\\n\\nStarting over:\\n\\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524? Wait, hold on, 3*9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Wait, did I do that right?\\n\\nWait, 9,841 * 3: 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 800 * 3 = 2,400; 40 * 3 = 120; 1 * 3 = 3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then add 1: 29,524. So, Level 9: 29,524.\\n\\nThen Level 10: 1 + 3*29,524 = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573.\\n\\nWait, now I get 88,573 instead of 88,570 earlier. So, I think I miscalculated Level 9 earlier. Let me double-check.\\n\\nLevel 8: 9,841\\n\\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9,841\\n\\nCompute 3*9,841:\\n\\n9,841 * 3:\\n\\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\\n\\n800 * 3 = 2,400 \\u2192 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\\n\\n40 * 3 = 120 \\u2192 29,400 + 120 = 29,520\\n\\n1 * 3 = 3 \\u2192 29,520 + 3 = 29,523\\n\\nSo, 3*9,841 = 29,523. Then add 1: 29,523 + 1 = 29,524. So, Level 9: 29,524.\\n\\nThen Level 10: 1 + 3*29,524.\\n\\nCompute 3*29,524:\\n\\n29,524 * 3:\\n\\n29,000 * 3 = 87,000\\n\\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \\u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\\n\\n24 * 3 = 72 \\u2192 88,500 + 72 = 88,572\\n\\nThen add 1: 88,572 + 1 = 88,573.\\n\\nSo, the final result is 88,573.\\n\\nBut wait, in my initial computation, I thought Level 10 was 88,570, but that was incorrect because I miscalculated Level 9 as 29,523 instead of 29,524.\\n\\nSo, the correct computation is 88,573.\\n\\nBut let me check another way to make sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression.\\n\\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\\n\\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\\n\\nThe recurrence is:\\n\\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\\n\\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\\n\\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\\n\\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\\n\\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\\n\\nK = 3*K + 1\\n\\nSolving for K:\\n\\nK - 3*K = 1 \\u2192 -2*K = 1 \\u2192 K = -1/2\\n\\nSo, the general solution is:\\n\\na_n = C*3^n - 1/2\\n\\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\\n\\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \\u2192 4 = 3*C - 1/2\\n\\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\\n\\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C \\u2192 9/2 = 3*C \\u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\\n\\nSo, the closed-form solution is:\\n\\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\n\\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\n\\nSo, for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\\n\\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\\n\\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches.\\n\\nOkay, so this formula seems correct.\\n\\nTherefore, for the original problem, which has 10 levels (n=10), the result is:\\n\\na_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2\\n\\nCompute 3^11:\\n\\n3^1 = 3\\n\\n3^2 = 9\\n\\n3^3 = 27\\n\\n3^4 = 81\\n\\n3^5 = 243\\n\\n3^6 = 729\\n\\n3^7 = 2,187\\n\\n3^8 = 6,561\\n\\n3^9 = 19,683\\n\\n3^10 = 59,049\\n\\n3^11 = 177,147\\n\\nSo, 3^11 = 177,147\\n\\nThen, a_10 = (177,147 - 1)/2 = 177,146 / 2 = 88,573\\n\\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\\n\\nTherefore, the result is 88,573.\\n\\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88,573.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe value of the expression is \\\\boxed{88573}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way out.

It looks pretty complicated at first glance with all those parentheses, but I think if I break it down step by step, it should become manageable. Let me write it out again to make sure I have it right:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nWow, that's a lot of nesting! Okay, so the structure is a series of nested expressions where each time, it's 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. It seems like a recursive pattern. Maybe I can work from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested parentheses.\\n\\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses are at the end, right? So the very last part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\\n\\nStarting with the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nSo, replacing that part, the next layer out would be 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that step down.\\n\\nSecond layer from the end:\\n1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nWait, hold on. Is that right? Let me check. The expression is 1 + 3(4). So yes, that would be 1 + 12, which is 13. Okay, that makes sense.\\n\\nNow, moving one layer out, the next part is 1 + 3(13). Let me compute that.\\n\\nThird layer:\\n1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nHmm, that's getting bigger quickly. Let me proceed to the next layer.\\n\\nFourth layer:\\n1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nWhoa, that's a nice round number. Let me keep going.\\n\\nFifth layer:\\n1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nHmm, 364. That's a big number, but I can handle it.\\n\\nSixth layer:\\n1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nOkay, 1093. That's the sixth layer. Let me note that down.\\n\\nSeventh layer:\\n1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nHmm, 3280. That's the seventh layer. Moving on.\\n\\nEighth layer:\\n1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nAlright, 9841. So that's the eighth layer.\\n\\nNinth layer:\\n1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nWait, let me verify that. 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That seems correct.\\n\\nOkay, so after computing all those layers, I have 29524 as the result of the innermost nine layers. But wait, looking back at the original problem, how many layers do I have? Let me count.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So let's see:\\n\\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\\n2. 1 + 3(4) = 13\\n3. 1 + 3(13) = 40\\n4. 1 + 3(40) = 121\\n5. 1 + 3(121) = 364\\n6. 1 + 3(364) = 1093\\n7. 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\\n8. 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\\n9. 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\\n\\nSo that's nine layers. But the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by all that. So the entire expression is 3 times the result of the innermost nine layers.\\n\\nWait, so do I have to multiply 3 by 29524? Let me check.\\n\\nYes, the original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression. So after computing the nested part, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\\n\\nTherefore, the total is 3 * 29524.\\n\\nLet me compute that.\\n\\n3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down.\\n\\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\\n\\n9,524 * 3 = 28,572\\n\\nSo adding those together, 60,000 + 28,572 = 88,572.\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me do it step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.\\n\\n29524 * 3:\\n\\nFirst, 2 * 3 = 6, carry over 5.\\n\\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 5 is 32, write down 2, carry over 3.\\n\\n5 * 3 = 15, plus 3 is 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\\n\\n4 * 3 = 12, plus 1 is 13, write down 13.\\n\\nSo that gives 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\\n\\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check my layers. I computed nine layers, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Then multiplied by 3 at the end. So 3 * 29524 is indeed 88,572.\\n\\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. It's easy to miscount or miscalculate when dealing with so many layers.\\n\\nLet me recount the layers:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\n7. 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\n8. 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\n9. 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n\\nYes, that's nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, so 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nWait a second, let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression has 8 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n(1 + 3) - 1\\n\\nThen (1 + 3(...)) - 2\\n\\n(1 + 3(...)) - 3\\n\\n(1 + 3(...)) - 4\\n\\n(1 + 3(...)) - 5\\n\\n(1 + 3(...)) - 6\\n\\n(1 + 3(...)) - 7\\n\\n(1 + 3(...)) - 8\\n\\nWait, hold on. The original expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each (1 + 3(...) adds another layer.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. (1 + 3)\\n\\n2. (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n3. (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n4. (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n5. (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n6. (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n7. (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n8. (1 + 3(...))\\n\\nSo that's 8 layers. Wait, but in my earlier computation, I did 9 layers. Hmm, maybe I overcounted.\\n\\nWait, let me see. The innermost is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer is another (1 + 3(...)). So how many layers are there?\\n\\nLooking at the expression:\\n\\nStarting with the innermost: 1 + 3\\n\\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\\n\\nThen: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\\n\\nContinuing this way, each time adding another layer.\\n\\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\\n\\nLooking at the original expression:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nLet's count the number of opening parentheses after the 3:\\n\\n1. After the first 3: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n2. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n3. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n4. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n5. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n6. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n7. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n8. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n9. Inside that: (1 + 3)\\n\\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers because the innermost is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from 1, going up to 9 layers.\\n\\nTherefore, my initial calculation of 9 layers is correct. So, the result is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer step by step again:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 is the result of the innermost 9 layers. Then, we have to multiply that by 3, which is the coefficient at the very beginning.\\n\\nSo, 3 * 29,524. Let me compute that again.\\n\\n29,524 * 3:\\n\\nMultiply each digit:\\n\\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\\n\\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\\n\\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\\n\\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\\n\\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\\n\\nSo, putting it together: 88,572.\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\\n\\nI think that's the final answer. But just to make sure, let me try computing it in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help verify this result without computing each layer step by step.\\n\\nLooking at the structure of the problem, it seems like a repeated application of the operation (1 + 3x), where x is the result of the previous layer. This kind of recursive structure might have a pattern or a closed-form solution.\\n\\nLet me try to model this as a recurrence relation. Let\\u2019s denote a_n as the result of the nth layer. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nThen,\\n\\na_1 = 4\\n\\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\\n\\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\\n\\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\\n\\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\\n\\nSo, this matches my earlier computations. Therefore, the result after 9 layers is 29,524. Multiplying by the initial 3 gives 88,572.\\n\\nAlternatively, is there a closed-form formula for this kind of recurrence relation?\\n\\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\\n\\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\\n\\nFirst, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\\n\\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\\n\\nPlugging into the recurrence:\\n\\nC = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\\n\\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\\n\\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\\n\\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\\n\\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\\n\\nCompute 3^{10}:\\n\\n3^1 = 3\\n\\n3^2 = 9\\n\\n3^3 = 27\\n\\n3^4 = 81\\n\\n3^5 = 243\\n\\n3^6 = 729\\n\\n3^7 = 2,187\\n\\n3^8 = 6,561\\n\\n3^9 = 19,683\\n\\n3^{10} = 59,049\\n\\nTherefore, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\\n\\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, the closed-form formula gives me the same value, 29,524, for the ninth layer. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, I can confirm that the result is indeed 88,572.\\n\\nAlternatively, just to ensure that the closed-form formula is correct, let me test it with n=1.\\n\\na_1 should be 4.\\n\\nUsing the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\\n\\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\\n\\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\\n\\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\\n\\nSo, the closed-form formula works for these values. Therefore, confident that a_9 = 29,524.\\n\\nThus, the final result is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then I derived a closed-form solution to verify the result, and both methods gave me the same answer.

      "    \"full_cot\": \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\\\boxed{}. Problem: Compute\\n\\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ Solution: \\n<think>\\nAlright, so I have this math problem here that I need to compute. It looks pretty complicated at first glance with all those parentheses, but I think if I break it down step by step, it should become manageable. Let me write it out again to make sure I have it right:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nWow, that's a lot of nesting! Okay, so the structure is a series of nested expressions where each time, it's 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. It seems like a recursive pattern. Maybe I can work from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested parentheses.\\n\\nLet me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses are at the end, right? So the very last part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\\n\\nStarting with the innermost:\\n\\n1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nSo, replacing that part, the next layer out would be 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that step down.\\n\\nSecond layer from the end:\\n1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nWait, hold on. Is that right? Let me check. The expression is 1 + 3(4). So yes, that would be 1 + 12, which is 13. Okay, that makes sense.\\n\\nNow, moving one layer out, the next part is 1 + 3(13). Let me compute that.\\n\\nThird layer:\\n1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nHmm, that's getting bigger quickly. Let me proceed to the next layer.\\n\\nFourth layer:\\n1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nWhoa, that's a nice round number. Let me keep going.\\n\\nFifth layer:\\n1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nHmm, 364. That's a big number, but I can handle it.\\n\\nSixth layer:\\n1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\n\\nOkay, 1093. That's the sixth layer. Let me note that down.\\n\\nSeventh layer:\\n1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\n\\nHmm, 3280. That's the seventh layer. Moving on.\\n\\nEighth layer:\\n1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\n\\nAlright, 9841. So that's the eighth layer.\\n\\nNinth layer:\\n1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\n\\nWait, let me verify that. 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That seems correct.\\n\\nOkay, so after computing all those layers, I have 29524 as the result of the innermost nine layers. But wait, looking back at the original problem, how many layers do I have? Let me count.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So let's see:\\n\\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\\n2. 1 + 3(4) = 13\\n3. 1 + 3(13) = 40\\n4. 1 + 3(40) = 121\\n5. 1 + 3(121) = 364\\n6. 1 + 3(364) = 1093\\n7. 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\\n8. 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\\n9. 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\\n\\nSo that's nine layers. But the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by all that. So the entire expression is 3 times the result of the innermost nine layers.\\n\\nWait, so do I have to multiply 3 by 29524? Let me check.\\n\\nYes, the original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression. So after computing the nested part, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\\n\\nTherefore, the total is 3 * 29524.\\n\\nLet me compute that.\\n\\n3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down.\\n\\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\\n\\n9,524 * 3 = 28,572\\n\\nSo adding those together, 60,000 + 28,572 = 88,572.\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me do it step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.\\n\\n29524 * 3:\\n\\nFirst, 2 * 3 = 6, carry over 5.\\n\\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 5 is 32, write down 2, carry over 3.\\n\\n5 * 3 = 15, plus 3 is 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\\n\\n4 * 3 = 12, plus 1 is 13, write down 13.\\n\\nSo that gives 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\\n\\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check my layers. I computed nine layers, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Then multiplied by 3 at the end. So 3 * 29524 is indeed 88,572.\\n\\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. It's easy to miscount or miscalculate when dealing with so many layers.\\n\\nLet me recount the layers:\\n\\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\n7. 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\n8. 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\n9. 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n\\nYes, that's nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, so 3*29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nWait a second, let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression has 8 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them:\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n(1 + 3) - 1\\n\\nThen (1 + 3(...)) - 2\\n\\n(1 + 3(...)) - 3\\n\\n(1 + 3(...)) - 4\\n\\n(1 + 3(...)) - 5\\n\\n(1 + 3(...)) - 6\\n\\n(1 + 3(...)) - 7\\n\\n(1 + 3(...)) - 8\\n\\nWait, hold on. The original expression is:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nSo let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each (1 + 3(...) adds another layer.\\n\\nStarting from the innermost:\\n\\n1. (1 + 3)\\n\\n2. (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n3. (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n4. (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n5. (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n6. (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n7. (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n8. (1 + 3(...))\\n\\nSo that's 8 layers. Wait, but in my earlier computation, I did 9 layers. Hmm, maybe I overcounted.\\n\\nWait, let me see. The innermost is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer is another (1 + 3(...)). So how many layers are there?\\n\\nLooking at the expression:\\n\\nStarting with the innermost: 1 + 3\\n\\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\\n\\nThen: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\\n\\nContinuing this way, each time adding another layer.\\n\\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\\n\\nLooking at the original expression:\\n\\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\n\\nLet's count the number of opening parentheses after the 3:\\n\\n1. After the first 3: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n2. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n3. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n4. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n5. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n6. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n7. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n8. Inside that: (1 + 3(...))\\n\\n9. Inside that: (1 + 3)\\n\\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers because the innermost is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from 1, going up to 9 layers.\\n\\nTherefore, my initial calculation of 9 layers is correct. So, the result is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer step by step again:\\n\\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\\n\\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\n\\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\n\\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\n\\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\n\\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\n\\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\n\\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\n\\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 is the result of the innermost 9 layers. Then, we have to multiply that by 3, which is the coefficient at the very beginning.\\n\\nSo, 3 * 29,524. Let me compute that again.\\n\\n29,524 * 3:\\n\\nMultiply each digit:\\n\\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\\n\\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\\n\\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\\n\\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\\n\\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\\n\\nSo, putting it together: 88,572.\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\\n\\nI think that's the final answer. But just to make sure, let me try computing it in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help verify this result without computing each layer step by step.\\n\\nLooking at the structure of the problem, it seems like a repeated application of the operation (1 + 3x), where x is the result of the previous layer. This kind of recursive structure might have a pattern or a closed-form solution.\\n\\nLet me try to model this as a recurrence relation. Let\\u2019s denote a_n as the result of the nth layer. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\\n\\nThen,\\n\\na_1 = 4\\n\\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\\n\\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\\n\\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\\n\\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\\n\\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\\n\\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\\n\\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\\n\\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\\n\\nSo, this matches my earlier computations. Therefore, the result after 9 layers is 29,524. Multiplying by the initial 3 gives 88,572.\\n\\nAlternatively, is there a closed-form formula for this kind of recurrence relation?\\n\\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\\n\\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\\n\\nFirst, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\\n\\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\\n\\nPlugging into the recurrence:\\n\\nC = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\\n\\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\\n\\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\\n\\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\\n\\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\\n\\nSimplify:\\n\\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\\n\\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\\n\\nCompute 3^{10}:\\n\\n3^1 = 3\\n\\n3^2 = 9\\n\\n3^3 = 27\\n\\n3^4 = 81\\n\\n3^5 = 243\\n\\n3^6 = 729\\n\\n3^7 = 2,187\\n\\n3^8 = 6,561\\n\\n3^9 = 19,683\\n\\n3^{10} = 59,049\\n\\nTherefore, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\\n\\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, the closed-form formula gives me the same value, 29,524, for the ninth layer. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\\n\\nTherefore, I can confirm that the result is indeed 88,572.\\n\\nAlternatively, just to ensure that the closed-form formula is correct, let me test it with n=1.\\n\\na_1 should be 4.\\n\\nUsing the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\\n\\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\\n\\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\\n\\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\\n\\nSo, the closed-form formula works for these values. Therefore, confident that a_9 = 29,524.\\n\\nThus, the final result is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\\n\\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then I derived a closed-form solution to verify the result, and both methods gave me the same answer.

Hmm, it looks a bit complicated with all those nested parentheses and 3s. But maybe I can break it down step by step.\\n\\nLet me start from the innermost part.

Then, adding 1 gives \\\\( 1 + 363 = 364 \\\\).\\n\\nNext layer: \\\\( 1 + 3(364) \\\\). Calculating 3 times 364. Hmm, 3 times 300 is 900, 3 times 60 is 180, and 3 times 4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Adding 1 gives \\\\( 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\\\).\\n\\nGoing out another layer, the expression is \\\\( 1 + 3(1093) \\\\). Calculating 3 times 1093. Let's see, 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Adding 1 gives \\\\( 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\\\).\\n\\nContinuing to the next layer, it's \\\\( 1 + 3(3280) \\\\). Computing 3 times 3280. 3000 times 3 is 9000, 280 times 3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives \\\\( 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\\\).\\n\\nMoving out one more layer, the expression is \\\\( 1 + 3(9841) \\\\). Let me calculate 3 times 9841. 9000 times 3 is 27,000, 800 times 3 is 2,400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Adding 1 gives \\\\( 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \\\\).\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that last calculation because 3 times 9841 might be a bit tricky. 9841 times 3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400; 29,400 + 120 is 29,520; 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. Yes, that's correct. So, adding 1 gives 29,524.\\n\\nNow, going one layer out, the next expression is \\\\( 1 + 3(29,524) \\\\). Calculating 3 times 29,524. Let's do it step by step: 29,524 times 3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3 times 29,524 is 88,572. Adding 1 gives \\\\( 1 + 88,572 = 88,573 \\\\).\\n\\nFinally, the outermost layer is \\\\( 3 \\\\times 88,573 \\\\). Let me compute that. 80,000 times 3 is 240,000; 8,000 times 3 is 24,000; 500 times 3 is 1,500; 70 times 3 is 210; 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those up: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. So, 3 times 88,573 is 265,719.\\n\\nWait, let me verify that multiplication because it's a big number. 88,573 times 3: 80,000*3=240,000; 8,000*3=24,000; 500*3=1,500; 70*3=210; 3*3=9. So, 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000; plus 1,500 is 265,500; plus 210 is 265,710; plus 9 is 265,719. Yes, that seems correct.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each time calculating the value step by step, I arrive at 265,719 as the final result.\\n\\nI think that's all. It took a while, but breaking it down layer by layer helped me manage the complexity of the expression. I didn't make any mistakes that I can see, but it's always good to double-check each step, especially when dealing with larger numbers. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify this process, but for now, I'll stick with the step-by-step approach since it worked.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe computed value is \\\\boxed{265719}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the expression \\\\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out step by step.\\n\\n1.
